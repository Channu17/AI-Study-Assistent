W e shortly shall de/\\x0cne all the sym b ols used\\nin this expression/, so y ou can see wh yo u ri n terpretation of this regular expres/-\\nsion is the correct one/. Before describing the regular/-expression notation/, w e\\nneed to learn the three op erations on languages that the op erators of regular\\nexpressions represen t/. These op erations are/:\\n/1/. The union of t w o languages L and M /, denoted L /[ M /, is the set of strings\\nthat are in either L or M /, or b oth/. F or example/, if L /= f /0/0/1 /;; /1/0 /;; /1/1/1 g and\\nM /= f /\\x0f/;; /0/0/1 g /, then L /[ M /= f /\\x0f/;; /1/0 /;; /0/0/1 /;; /1/1/1 g /.\\n/2/. The c onc atenation of languages L and M is the set of strings that can\\nb e formed b y taking an y string in L and concatenating it with an y string\\nin M /. Recall Section /1/./5/./2/, where w e de/\\x0cned the concatenation of a\\npair of strings/;; one string is follo w ed b y the other to form the result of the\\nconcatenation/. W e denote concatenation of languages either with a dot or\\nwith no op erator at all/, although the concatenation op erator is frequen tly\\ncalled /\\\\dot/./\" F or example/, if L /= f /0/0/1 /;; /1/0 /;; /1/1/1 g and M /= f /\\x0f/;; /0/0/1 g /, then\\nL/:M /,o r j u s t LM /,i s f /0/0/1 /;; /1/0 /;; /1/1/1 /;; /0/0/1/0/0 /1 /;; /1 /0/0 /0/1 /;; /1/1 /1/0 /0/1 g /. The /\\x0crst three\\nstrings in LM are the strings in L concatenated with /\\x0f /. Since /\\x0f is the\\niden tit y for concatenation/, the resulting strings are the same as the strings\\nof L /. Ho w ev er/, the last three strings in LM are formed b y taking eac h\\nstring in L and concatenating it with the second string in M /, whic h is\\n/0/0/1/.

ALGEBRAIC LA WS F OR REGULAR EXPRESSIONS /1/1/5\\n/3/./4 Algebraic La ws for Regular Expressions\\nIn Example /3/./5/, w es a w the need for simplifying regular expressions/, in order to\\nk eep the size of expressions manageable/. There/, w eg a v e some ad/-ho c argumen ts\\nwh y one expression could b e replaced b y another/. In all cases/, the basic issue\\nw as that the t w o expressions w ere e quivalent /, in the sense that they de/\\x0cned\\nthe same languages/. In this section/, w e shall o/\\x0ber a collection of algebraic\\nla ws that bring to a higher lev el the issue of when t w o regular expressions are\\nequiv alen t/. Instead of examining sp eci/\\x0cc regular expressions/, w e shall consider\\npairs of regular expressions with v ariables as argumen ts/. Tw o expressions with\\nv ariables are e quivalent if whatev er languages w e substitute for the v ariables/,\\nthe results of the t w o expressions are the same language/.\\nAn example of this pro cess in the algebra of arithmetic is as follo ws/. It is\\none matter to sa y that /1 /+ /2 /= /2 /+ /1/. That is an example of the comm utativ el a w\\nof addition/, and it is easy to c hec kb y applying the addition op erator on b oth\\nsides and getting /3 /= /3/. Ho w ev er/, the c ommutative law of addition sa ys more/;;\\nit sa ys that x /+ y /= y /+ x /, where x and y are v ariables that can b e replaced\\nb ya n yt w on um be r s /. That is/, no matter what t w on um b ers w ea d d /,w e get the\\nsame result regardless of the order in whic hw e sum them/.\\nLik e arithmetic expressions/, the regular expressions ha v ea n um be r o f l a ws\\nthat w ork for them/. Man y of these are similar to the la ws for arithmetic/, if w e\\nthink of union as addition and concatenation as m ultiplication/. Ho w ev er/, there\\nare a few places where the analogy breaks do wn/, and there are also some la ws\\nthat apply to regular expressions but ha v e no analog for arithmetic/, esp ecially\\nwhen the closure op erator is in v olv ed/. The next sections form a catalog of the\\nma jor la ws/. W e conclude with a discussion of ho w one can c hec k whether a\\nprop osed la w for regular expressions is indeed a la w/;; i/.e/./, it will hold for an y\\nlanguages that w em a y substitute for the v ariables/.\\n/3/./4/./1 Asso ciativit y and Comm utativit y\\nCommutativity is the prop ert y of an op erator that sa ys w e can switc h the order\\nof its op erands and get the same result/. An example for arithmetic w as giv en\\nab o v e/: x /+ y /= y /+ x /. Asso ciativity is the prop ert y of an op erator that allo ws\\nus to regroup the op erands when the op erator is applied t wice/. F or example/,\\nthe asso ciativ el a wo f m ultiplication is /( x /\\x02 y /) /\\x02 z /= x /\\x02 /( y /\\x02 z /)/.

CONTEXT/-FREE GRAMMARS AND LANGUA GES\\nthe pro cess of /\\\\deriv ation/,/\" whereb y it is determined whic h strings are in the\\nlanguage of the grammar/.\\n/5/./1/./1 An Informal Example\\nLet us consider the language of palindromes/. A p alindr ome is a string that reads\\nthe same forw ard and bac kw ard/, suc ha s otto or madamimadam /(/\\\\Madam/, I/\\'m\\nAdam/,/\" allegedly the /\\x0crst thing Ev e heard in the Garden of Eden/)/. Put another\\nw a y /, string w is a palindrome if and only if w /= w\\nR\\n/. T o mak e things simple/,\\nw e shall consider describing only the palindromes with alphab et f /0 /;; /1 g /. This\\nlanguage includes strings lik e /0/1/1/0/, /1/1/0/1/1/, and /\\x0f /, but not /0/1/1 or /0/1/0/1/.\\nIt is easy to v erify that the language L\\npal\\nof palindromes of /0/\\'s and /1/\\'s is\\nnot a regular language/. T o do so/, w e use the pumping lemma/. If L\\npal\\nis a\\nregular language/, let n b e the asso ciated constan t/, and consider the palindrome\\nw /=/0\\nn\\n/1/0\\nn\\n/. If L\\npal\\nis regular/, then w e can break w in to w /= xy z /, suc h that\\ny consists of one or more /0/\\'s from the /\\x0crst group/. Th us/, xz /,w h i c hw ould also\\nha v et ob e i n L\\npal\\nif L\\npal\\nw ere regular/, w ould ha v e few er /0/\\'s to the left of the\\nlone /1 than there are to the righ t of the /1/. Therefore xz cannot b e a palindrome/.\\nW eh a v en o wc o n tradicted the assumption that L\\npal\\nis a regular language/.\\nThere is a natural/, recursiv e de/\\x0cnition of when a string of /0/\\'s and /1/\\'s is in\\nL\\npal\\n/. It starts with a basis sa ying that a few ob vious strings are in L\\npal\\n/, and\\nthen exploits the idea that if a string is a palindrome/, it m ust b egin and end\\nwith the same sym b ol/. F urther/, when the /\\x0crst and last sym b ols are remo v ed/,\\nthe resulting string m ust also b e a palindrome/. That is/:\\nBASIS /: /\\x0f /, /0/, and /1 are palindromes/.\\nINDUCTION /:I f w is a palindrome/, so are /0 w /0a n d /1 w /1/. No string is a palin/-\\ndrome of /0/\\'s and /1/\\'s/, unless it follo ws from this basis and induction rule/.\\nA con text/-free grammar is a formal notation for expressing suc h recursiv e\\nde/\\x0cnitions of languages/. A grammar consists of one or more v ariables that\\nrepresen t classes of strings/, i/.e/./, languages/. In this example w eh a v e need for\\nonly one v ariable P /,w h i c h represen ts the set of palindromes/;; that is the class of\\nstrings forming the language L\\npal\\n/. There are rules that sa yh o w the strings in\\neac h class are constructed/. The construction can use sym b ols of the alphab et/,\\nstrings that are already kno wn to b e in one of the classes/, or b oth/.\\nExample /5/./1 /: The rules that de/\\x0cne the palindromes/, expressed in the con text/-\\nfree grammar notation/, are sho wn in Fig/. /5/./1/. W e shall see in Section /5/./1/./2 what\\nthe rules mean/.\\nThe /\\x0crst three rules form the basis/. They tell us that the class of palindromes\\nincludes the strings /\\x0f /, /0/, and /1/. None of the righ t sides of these rules /(the\\np ortions follo wing the arro ws/) con tains a v ariable/, whic h is wh y they form a\\nbasis for the de/\\x0cnition/.\\nThe last t w o rules form the inductiv e part of the de/\\x0cnition/. F or instance/,\\nrule /4 sa ys that if w e tak ea n y string w from the class P /,t h e n/0 w /0 is also in\\nclass P /. Rule /5 lik ewise tells us that /1 w /1i sa l s oi n P /. /2'),\n",

This set of states\\nincludes a start state and another state that temp orarily has no mo v es/, and\\nthat serv es as the /\\\\return/\" state to pass con trol to whatev er other set of states\\ncalled the subroutine/. The /\\\\call/\" of a subroutine oc c u r s whenev er there is a\\ntransition to its initial state/. Since the TM has no mec hanism for remem b ering\\na /\\\\return address/,/\" that is/, a state to go to after it /\\x0cnishes/, should our design\\nof a TM call for one subroutine to b e called from sev eral states/, w e can mak e\\ncopies of the subroutine/, using a new set of states for eac hc o p y /. The /\\\\calls/\"\\nare made to the start states of di/\\x0beren t copies of the subroutine/, and eac hc o p y\\n/\\\\returns/\" to a di/\\x0beren t state/.\\nExample /8/./8 /: W e shall design a TM to implemen t the function /\\\\m ultiplica/-\\ntion/./\" That is/, our TM will start with /0\\nm\\n/1/0\\nn\\n/1 on its tap e/, and will end with\\n/0\\nmn\\non the tap e/. An outline of the strategy is/:\\n/1/. The tap e will/, in general/, ha v eo n e n o n blank string of the form /0\\ni\\n/1/0\\nn\\n/1/0\\nkn\\nfor some k /.\\n/2/. In one basic step/, w ec hange a /0 in the /\\x0crst group to B and add n /0/\\'s to\\nthe last group/, giving us a string of the form /0\\ni /; /1\\n/1/0\\nn\\n/1/0\\n/( k /+/1/) n\\n/.\\n/3/. As a result/, w e cop y the group of n /0/\\'s to the end m times/, once eac h\\ntime w ec hange a /0 in the /\\x0crst group to B /. When the /\\x0crst group of /0/\\'s is\\ncompletely c hanged to blanks/, there will b e mn /0/\\'s in the last group/.\\n/4/. The /\\x0cnal step is to c hange the leading /1/0\\nn\\n/1 to blanks/, and w e are done/.\\nThe heart of this algorithm is a subroutine/, whic hw e call Copy /. This sub/-\\nroutine helps implemen t step /(/2/) ab o v e/, cop ying the blo c ko f n /0/\\'s to the end/.\\nMore precisely /, Copy con v erts an ID of the form /0\\nm /; k\\n/1 q\\n/1\\n/0\\nn\\n/1/0\\n/( k /; /1/) n\\nto ID\\n/0\\nm /; k\\n/1 q\\n/5\\n/0\\nn\\n/1/0\\nkn\\n/.

INTR ODUCTION TO TURING MA CHINES\\nA Reminder Ab out Finiteness\\nA common fallacy is to confuse a v alue that is /\\x0cnite at an y time with a set\\nof v alues that is /\\x0cnite/. The man y/-tap es/-to/-one construction ma y help us\\nappreciate the di/\\x0berence/. In that construction/, w eu s e dt r a c ks on the tap e\\nto record the p ositions of the tap e heads/. Wh y could w e not store these\\np ositions as in tegers in the /\\x0cnite con trol/? Carelessly /, one could argue that\\nafter n mo v es/, the TM can ha v e tap e head p ositions that m u s tb ew i t h i n\\nn p ositions of original head p ositions/, and so the head only has to store\\nin tegers up to n /.\\nThe problem is that/, while the p ositions are /\\x0cnite at an y time/, the\\ncomplete set of p ositions p ossible at an y time is in/\\x0cnite/. If the state is\\nto represen ta n y head p osition/, then there m ust b e a data comp onen to f\\nthe state that has an yi n teger as v alue/. This comp onen t forces the set of\\nstates to b e in/\\x0cnite/, ev en if only a /\\x0cnite n um b er of them can b e used at\\nan y /\\x0cnite time/. The de/\\x0cnition of a T uring mac hine requires that the set\\nof states b e /\\x0cnite/. Th us/, it is not p ermissible to store a tap e/-head p osition\\nin the /\\x0cnite con trol/.\\nT os i m ulate a mo v eo f M /, N /\\'s head m ust visit the k head mark ers/. So that\\nN not get lost/, it m ust remem be r h o wm a n y head mark ers are to its left at all\\ntimes/;; that coun t is stored as a comp onen to f N /\\'s /\\x0cnite con trol/. After visiting\\neac h head mark er and storing the scanned sym b ol in a comp onen t of its /\\x0cnite\\ncon trol/, N kno ws what tap e sym b ols are b eing scanned b ye a c ho f M /\\'s heads/.\\nN also kno ws the state of M /, whic hi t s t o r e si n N /\\'s o wn /\\x0cnite con trol/.

In this section/, w e shall rep eat the idea with the additional formalit y\\nthat comes with talking ab out the T uring mac hine as our represen tation of a\\nstored program/.\\nW e de/\\x0cne L\\nu\\n/, the universal language /, to be the set of binary strings that\\nenco de/, in the notation of Section /9/./1/./2/, a pair /( M/;; w /)/, where M is a TM with\\nthe binary input alphab et/, and w is a string in /( /0 /+ /1 /)\\n/\\x03\\n/,s u c ht h a t w is in L /( M /)/.\\nThat is/, L\\nu\\nis the set of strings represen ting a TM and an input accepted b y\\nthat TM/.

Since the input to U is a binary string/, U is\\nin fact some M\\nj\\nin the list of binary/-input T uring mac hines w e dev elop ed in\\nSection /9/./1/./2/.\\nIt is easiest to describ e U as a m ultitap e T uring mac hine/, in the spirit of\\nFig/. /8/./2/2/. In the case of U /, the transitions of M are stored initially on the /\\x0crst\\ntap e/, along with the string w /. A second tap e will b e used to hold the sim ulated\\ntap e of M /, using the same format as for the co de of M /. That is/, tap e sym bo l\\nX\\ni\\nof M will b e represen ted b y/0\\ni\\n/,a n d t a p e s y m b ols will b e separated b y single\\n/1/\\'s/. The third tap e of U holds the state of M /, with state q\\ni\\nrepresen ted b y i\\n/0/\\'s/. As k etc ho f U is in Fig/. /9/./5/.\\nThe op eration of U can b e summarized as follo ws/:\\n/1/. Examine the input to mak e sure that the co de for M is a legitimate co de\\nfor some TM/. If not/, U halts without accepting/.
