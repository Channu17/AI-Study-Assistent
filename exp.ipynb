Whenthe third edition appeared in 1996, computer networks, especially the Internet, hadbecome a daily reality for millions of people.By the fourth edition, in 2003, wire-less networks and mobile computers had become commonplace for accessing theWeband the Internet.By the ﬁ fth edition, networks were about content distribu-tion (especially videos using CDNs and peer-to-peer networks) and mobile phones.Nowinthe sixth edition, industry emphasis on is very high performance, with 5Gcellular networks, 100-gigabit Ethernet, and 802.11ax WiFi at speeds up to 11Gbps just around the corner.New in the Sixth EditionAmong the manychanges in this book, the most important one is the additionof Prof. Nick Feamster as a co-author.Prof. Feamster has a Ph.D. from M.I.T.andis nowafull professor at the University of Chicago.Another important change is that Chapter 8 (on security) has been very heavilymodiﬁ ed by Prof. Herbert Bos of the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam.The focushas movedfrom cryptographytonetwork security.The issues of hacking, DoSattacks and so much more is front-and-center in the news almost every day,soweare very grateful that Prof. Bos has redone the chapter to deal with these importantissues in detail.The chapter discusses vulnerabilities, howtoﬁ xthem, howhack-ers respond to the ﬁ xes, howthe defenders react, and so on ad inﬁ nitum.Thematerial on cryptographyhas been reduced somewhat to makeroom for the largeamount of newmaterial on network security.Of course, the book also has manyother changes to keep up with the ever-changing world of computer networks.

Speciﬁ c updates includingadding additional discussions on the Internet of Things and modern cellular archi-tectures, including 4G and 5G networks. Much of the discussion on Internet policyhas also been updated, particularly the discussion on net neutrality.Chapter 2 has been updated to include discussion of more prevalent physicalmedia in access networks, such as DOCSIS and ﬁ ber arhictectures. Treatment ofmodern cellular network architectures and technologies was added, and the sectionon satellite networks was also substantially updated. Emerging technologies suchas virtualization were added, including discussions on mobile virtual network oper-ators and cellular network slicing. The policydiscussion was reorganized andupdated to include discussion on policyquestions in the wireless arena, such asspectrum.Chapter 3 has been updated to include DOCSIS as a protocol example, as it isawidely used access technology.Much of the error correction codes are, of course,timeless.Chapter 4 has been brought up to date, with newmaterial on 40- and 100-giga-bit Ethernet, 802.11.ac, 802.11ad, and 802.11ax.Newmaterial has been added onDOCSIS, explaining the MACsublayer in cable networks. Thematerial on 802.16has been removedasitnow appears that this technology is going to lose out to thecellular 4G and 5G technologies.The section on RFID has also been removedtomakespace for newmaterial, but also because it was not directly network related.Chapter 5 has been updated to clarify and modernize the discussions on con-gestion management.The sections on trafﬁ c management have been updated andclariﬁ ed, and the discussions on trafﬁ c shaping and trafﬁ c engineering have beenupdated. The chapter includes an entirely newsection on software-deﬁ ned net-working (SDN), including OpenFlowand programmable hardware (e.g., Toﬁ no).The chapter also includes discussion on emerging applications of SDN, such as in-band network telemetry.Some of the discussion on IPv6 has also been updated.Chapter 6 has been extensively edited to include newmaterial on moderntransport protocols, including TCP CUBIC, QUIC, and BBR. The material on per-formance measurement has been completely rewritten to focus on the measurementof throughput in computer networks, including an extensive discussion on the chal-lenges of measuring access network throughout as speeds in access ISPs increase.The chapter also includes newmaterial on measuring user quality of experience, anemerging area in performance measurement.Chapter 7 has been heavily edited. Over 60 pages of material that is no longerrelevant to a book on computer networks has been removed. Thematerial on DNShas been almost completely rewritten to reﬂ ect modern developments in DNS,including the ongoing trends to encrypt DNS and generally improve its privacycharacteristics. Emerging protocols such as DNS-over-HTTPS and other privacy-preserving techniques for DNS are discussed. The discussion of the Web has beenextensively updated, to reﬂ ect the increasing deployment of encryption on the Web,'),\n",

The chapter includes a completely newsection on Web privacy,more exten-sive discussions of modern content delivery technology (e.g., content delivery net-works), and an expanded discussion on peer-to-peer networks. The section on theevolution of the Internet has also been edited to reﬂ ect trends towards distributedcloud services.Chapter 8 has been completely overhauled. Inprevious editions, the focus ofthe security chapter was almost exclusively on information security by means ofcryptography. However, cryptographyisonly one aspect of network security and ifwe look at security incidents in practice, it is generally not the aspect where theproblems are.To remedy this, we added newcontent on security principles, funda-mental attack techniques, defenses, and a wide range of systems-related securityissues. Moreover, weupdated the existing sections by dropping some encryptiontechniques that are nowobsolete and introducing more modern versions of proto-cols and standards.Chapter 9 contains a renewed list of suggested readings and a comprehensivebibliography.In addition, dozens of newexercises and dozens of newreferences have beenadded.List of AcronymsComputer books are full of acronyms.

The19th century was the age of the steam engine.Duringthe 20th century,the key technology was information gathering, processing, anddistribution. Amongother developments, we sawthe deployment of worldwidetelephone networks, the invention of radio and television, the birth and unprece-dented growth of the computer industry,the launching of communication satellites,and, of course, the Internet.Who knows what miracles the 21st century will bring?As a result of this rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly con-verging in the 21st century,and the differences between collecting, transporting,storing, and processing information are quickly disappearing.Organizations withhundreds of offices spread overawide geographical area routinely expect to beable to examine the current status of eventheir most remote outpost at the push ofabutton. Asour ability to gather,process, and distribute information grows, thedemand for more sophisticated information processing grows evenfaster.1.1 USESOF COMPUTER NETWORKSAlthough the computing industry is still young compared to other technicalindustries such as automobiles and air transportation, computers have made spec-tacular progress in a short time.During the first twodecades of their existence,1'),\n",

Theidea thatwithin fifty years vastly more powerful computers smaller than postage stampswould be mass produced by the billions was science fiction.The convergence of computers and communications has had a profound influ-ence on the organization of computer systems.The once-dominant concept of the‘‘computer center’’asaroom with a single large computer to which users bringtheir work for processing is nowobsolete (although data centers holding hundredsof thousands of Internet servers are common).The old model of a single computerserving all of the organization’scomputational needs has been replaced by one inwhich a large number of separate but interconnected computers do the job.Thesesystems are calledcomputer networks.The design and organization of these net-works are the subjects of this book.Throughout the book, we will use the term ‘‘computer network’’tomean a col-lection of interconnected, autonomous computing devices. Two computers are saidto be interconnected if theycan exchange information.Interconnection can takeplace overavariety of transmission media including copper wire, fiber optic cable,and radio waves(e.g., microwave,infrared, communication satellites). Networkscome in manysizes, shapes, and forms, as we will explore throughout the book.Theyare usually connectedto makelarger networks, with theInternetbeing themost well-known example of a network of networks.1.1.1 Accessto InformationAccess to information comes in manyforms. A common method of accessinginformation via the Internet is using a Web browser,which allows a user to retrieveinformation from various Web sites, including increasingly popular social mediasites. Mobile applications on smartphones nowalso allowusers to access remoteinformation. Topics include the arts, business, cooking, government, health, his-tory,hobbies, recreation, science, sports, travel, and manyothers. Funcomes intoo manyways to mention, plus some ways that are better left unmentioned.News organizations have largely migrated online, with some evenceasing printoperations entirely.Access to information, including the news, is increasingly per-sonalizable. Someonline publications evenallowyou to tell them that you are in-terested in corrupt politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and epi-demics, but no football, thank you.This trend certainly threatens the employmentof 12-year-old paperboys, but online distribution has allowed the distribution ofnews to reach far larger and broader audiences.Increasingly,newsisalso being curated by social media platforms, where userscan post and share news content from a variety of sources, and where the news thatanygivenuser sees is prioritized and personalized based on both explicit user'),\n",

Themost popular realization is that of aWebapplication,where a servergenerates Web pages based on its database in response to client requests that mayupdate the database.The client-server model is applicable not only when the clientand server are both in the same building (and belong to the same company), butalso when theyare far apart.Forexample, when a person at home accesses a pageon the World Wide Web, the same model is employed, with the remote Web serverbeing the server and the user’spersonal computer being the client.Under mostconditions, one server can handle a large number (hundreds or thousands) of cli-ents simultaneously.If we look at the client-server model, to a first approximation we see that twoprocesses (running programs) are involved, one on the client machine and one onthe server machine.Communication takes the form of the client process sending a'),\n",

Every person can,in principle, communicate with one or more other people; there is no fixed divisioninto clients and servers.\\nFigure1-3.In a peer-to-peer system, there are no fixed clients and servers.Manypeer-to-peer systems, such as BitTorrent (Cohen, 2003), do not have acentral database of content.Instead, each user maintains a local database of con-tent, as well as a list of other members of the system.Anew user can then go toanyexisting member to see what he has and get the names of other members toinspect for more content and more names.This lookup process can be repeatedindefinitely to build up a large local database of what is out there.It is an activitythat would get tedious for people, but computers excel at it.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content='SEC. 1.1 USES OF COMPUTER NETWORKS 5Peer-to-peer communication is often used to share music and videos.It reallyhit the big time around 2000 with a music sharing service called Napster,whichwasshut down after a monumental copyright infringement case (Lam and Tan,2001; and Macedonia, 2000).Legalapplications for peer-to-peer communicationnowexist. Theseinclude fans sharing public domain music, families sharing pho-tos and movies, and users downloading public software packages.In fact, one ofthe most popular Internet applications of all, email, is (conceptually) peer-to-peer.This form of communication is likely to growconsiderably in the future.1.1.2 Person-to-Person CommunicationPerson-to-person communication is the 21st century’sanswer to the 19th cen-tury’stelephone. Emailis already used on a daily basis by millions of people alloverthe world and its use is growing rapidly.Italready routinely contains audioand video as well as text and pictures.Smell may takeawhile.ManyInternet users nowrely on some form ofinstant messagingto commun-icate with other people on the Internet.This facility,derivedfrom the UNIXtalkprogram in use since around 1970, allows twopeople to type messages at eachother in real time.There are also multi-person messaging services too, such as theTwitterservice, which lets people send short messages (possibly including video)called ‘‘tweets’’totheir circle of friends or other followers or the whole world.The Internet can be used by applications to carry audio (e.g., Internet radio sta-tions, streaming music services) and video (e.g., Netflix, YouTube). Besidesbeingan inexpensive way to communicate with your distant friends, these applicationscan provide rich experiences such as distance learning, meaning attending 8A.M.classes without the inconvenience of having to get out of bed first. Inthe long run,the use of networks to enhance human-to-human communication may prove moreimportant than anyofthe others.It may become hugely important to people whoare geographically challenged, giving them the same access to services as peopleliving in the middle of a big city.Between person-to-person communications and accessing information aresocial networkapplications. Inthese applications, the flowofinformation isdrivenbythe relationships that people declare between each other.One of themost popular social networking sites isFacebook.Itlets people create and updatetheir personal profiles and shares the updates with other people who theyhavedeclared to be their friends.Other social networking applications can makeintro-ductions via friends of friends, send news messages to friends, such as Twitterabove,and much more.Even more loosely,groups of people can work together to create content. Awiki,for example, is a collaborative Web site that the members of a communityedit. Themost famous wiki is theWikipedia,anencyclopedia anyone can read oredit, but there are thousands of other wikis.'),\n",

Manypeople already pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and evenhandle their investments electronically.Financial technology or ‘‘fintech’’applica-tions allowusers to conduct a wide variety of financial transactions online, includ-ing transferring moneybetween bank accounts, or evenbetween friends.Online auctions of second-hand goods have become a massive industry.Unliketraditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model, online auc-tions are peer-to-peer in the sense that consumers can act as both buyers and sell-ers, although there is a central server that holds the database of products for sale.Some of these forms of e-commerce have acquired cute little tags based on thefact that ‘‘to’’and ‘‘2’’are pronounced the same.The most popular ones are listedin Fig. 1-4.Tag Full nameExampleB2C Business-to-consumerOrderingbooks onlineB2B Business-to-business Carmanufacturer ordering tires from a supplierG2C Government-to-consumer Government distributing tax formselectronicallyC2C Consumer-to-consumerAuctioning second-hand products onlineP2P Peer-to-peer Musicor file sharing; SkypeFigure1-4.Some forms of e-commerce.1.1.4 EntertainmentOur fourth category is entertainment.This has made huge strides in the homein recent years, with the distribution of music, radio and television programs, andmovies overthe Internet beginning to rivalthat of traditional mechanisms.Userscan find, buy,and download MP3 songs and high-definition movies and add themto their personal collection.TV shows nowreach manyhomes viaIPTV(IP Tele-vision)systems that are based on IP technology instead of cable TV or radio trans-missions. Mediastreaming applications let users tune to Internet radio stations orwatch recent episodes of their favorite TV shows or movies. Naturally,all of thiscontent can be movedaround your house between different devices, displays, andspeakers, usually via a wireless network.Soon, it may be possible to search for anymovie or television program evermade, in anycountry,and have itbedisplayed on your screen instantly.New films'),\n",

Also,there are manymoresensors that can be folded into a smart home monitor,such as energy consumption.Smart electricity,gas, and water meters report usage overthe network. Thisfunc-tionality savesthe companymoneyasthere is then no need to send people to readthe meters.Smokedetectors can call the fire department instead of just making abig noise (which has little value if no one is home).Smart refrigerators could or-der more milk when it is almost gone.As the cost of sensing and communicationdrops, more and more measurement and reporting will be done with networks. Thisongoing revolution, often referred to as theIoT(Internet of Things), is poised toconnect just about every electronic device we purchase to the Internet.Increasingly,consumer electronic devices are networked. For example, somehigh-end cameras already have a wireless network capability and use it to sendphotos to a nearby display for viewing. Professionalsports photographers can alsosend their photos to their editors in real-time, first wirelessly to an access pointthen overthe Internet.Devices such as televisions that plug into the wall can usepower-line networksto send information throughout the house overthe wires thatcarry electricity.Itmay not be very surprising to have these objects on the net-work, but objects that we do not think of as computers may sense and communi-cate information too.Forexample, your shower may record water usage, give youvisual feedback while you lather up, and report to a home environmental moni-toring application when you are done to help save onyour water bill.1.2 TYPESOF COMPUTER NETWORKSThere are manydistinct types of computer networks.

Peopleinitially bought computers for wordprocessing and games. Nowthe prevailing reason to buy a home computer is toget Internet access.Also, manyconsumer electronic devices, such as set-top box-es, game consoles, television sets, and evendoor locks, come with embedded com-puters that access computer networks, especially wireless networks. Homenet-works are broadly used for entertainment, including listening to, looking at, andcreating music, photos, and videos.Internet access provides home users withconnectivityto remote computers.As with companies, home users can access information, communicate with otherpeople, and buy products and services.The main benefit nowcomes from con-necting these devices to other destinations outside of the home.Bob Metcalfe, theinventor of Ethernet, hypothesized that the value of a network is proportional to thesquare of the number of users because this is roughly the number of different con-nections that may be made (Gilder,1993). Thishypothesis is known as ‘‘Met-calfe’slaw.’’Ithelps to explain howthe tremendous popularity of the Internetcomes from its size.Today,broadband access networks are proliferating. In manyparts of theworld, broadband access is delivered to homes through copper (e.g., telephonelines), coaxial cable (e.g., cable), or optical fiber.The speeds of broadband Internetaccess continue to increase as well, with manybroadband access providers in de-veloped countries delivering a gigabit per second to individual homes. In someparts of the world, particularly in developing regions, the predominant mode of In-ternet access is mobile.1.2.2 Mobileand Wireless Access NetworksMobile computers, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones, are one of thefastest-growing segments of the computer industry.Their sales have already over-taken those of desktop computers.Whywould anyone want one?People on thego often want to use their mobile devices to read and send email, tweet, watchmovies, download music, play games, look at maps, or simply to surf the Web forinformation or fun.Theywant to do all of the things theydoathome and in theoffice. Naturally,theywant to do them from anywhere on land, sea, or in the air.'),\n",

Wirelesshotspotsbased on the 802.11 standard are another kind of wire-less network for mobile computers and portable devices such as phones and tablets.Theyhavesprung up everywhere that people go, resulting in a patchwork of cover-age at cafes, hotels, airports, schools, trains, and planes.Anyone with a mobile de-vice and a wireless modem can just turn on their computer and be connected to theInternet through the hotspot as though the computer were plugged into a wired net-work.Wireless networks are of great value to fleets of trucks, taxis, delivery vehicles,and repair-persons for keeping in contact with their home base.Forexample, inmanycities, taxi drivers are independent businessmen, rather than being employeesof a taxi company. Insome of these cities, the taxis have a display the drivercansee. Whenacustomer calls up, a central dispatcher types in the pickup and desti-nation points.This information is displayed on the drivers’ displays and a beepsounds. Thefirst drivertohit a button on the display gets the call. The rise ofmobile and wireless networking has also led to a revolution in ground tran-sportation itself, with the ‘‘sharing economy’’allowing drivers to use their onphones as a dispatch device, as with ride-sharing companies such as Uber and Lyft.Wireless networks are also important to the military.Ifyou have tobeable tofight a war anywhere on Earth at short notice, counting on using the local network-ing infrastructure is probably not a good idea.It is better to bring your own.Although wireless networking and mobile computing are often related, theyare not identical, as Fig.1-5 shows. Here,we see a distinction betweenfixed wire-lessandmobile wirelessnetworks. Even notebook computers are sometimeswired. For example, if a traveler plugs a laptop computer into the wired networkjack in a hotel room, he has mobility without a wireless network. The growing per-vasiveness of wireless networks is making this situation increasingly rare, althoughfor high performance, wired networks are always better.Wireless MobileTypical applicationsNo NoDesktop computers in officesNo Yes Alaptop computer used in a hotel roomYes NoNetworksin unwired buildingsYes Yes Storeinventorywith a handheld computerFigure1-5.Combinations of wireless networks and mobile computing.Conversely,some wireless computers are not mobile.In people’shomes, andin offices or hotels that lack suitable cabling, it can be more convenient to connectdesktop computers or media players wirelessly than to install wires.Installing a'),\n",

Theyscan the barcodes or RFID chips of returning cars, and their mobiledevice, which has a built-in printer,calls the main computer,gets the rental infor-mation, and prints out the bill on the spot.Akey driverofmobile, wireless applications is the mobile phone.The conver-gence between telephones and the Internet is accelerating the growth of mobile ap-plications.Smartphones,such as Apple’siPhone and Samsung’sGalaxy,com-bine aspects of mobile phones and mobile computers.These phones connect towireless hotspots, too, and automatically switch between networks to choose thebest option for the user.Text messagingortexting(orShort Message Serviceasit is known outside the U.S.)overthe cellular network was tremendously popularat its outset.It lets a mobile phone user type a short message that is then deliveredby the cellular network to another mobile subscriber.Texting is extremely profi-itable since it costs the carrier but a tinyfraction of one cent to relay a text mes-sage, a service for which it charges far more.Typing short text messages on mo-bile phones was, for a time, an immense moneymaker for mobile carriers. Now,manyalternativesthat use either the phone’scellular data plan or wireless network,including WhatsApp, Signal, and Facebook Messenger,haveovertaken SMS.Other consumer electronics devices can also use cellular and hotspot networksto stay connected to remote computers.Tablets and electronic book readers candownload a newly purchased book or the next edition of a magazine or today’snewspaper wherevertheyroam. Electronic picture frames can update their displayson cue with fresh images.Mobile phones typically knowtheir own locations.GPS(Global PositioningSystem)can directly locate a device, and mobile phones often also triangulate be-tween Wi-Fi hotspots with known locations to determine their location.Some ap-plications are location-dependent.Mobile maps and directions are an obvious can-didate as your GPS-enabled phone and car probably have a better idea of whereyou are than you do.So, too, are searches for a nearby bookstore or Chineserestaurant, or a local weather forecast.Other services may record location, such asannotating photos and videos with the place at which theywere made.This anno-tation is known asgeo-tagging.Mobile phones are being increasingly used inm-commerce(mobile-com-merce)(Senn, 2000).Short text messages from the mobile are used to authorizepayments for food in vending machines, movie tickets, and other small items in-stead of cash and credit cards.The charge then appears on the mobile phone bill.When equipped withNFC(Near Field Communication), technology the mobilecan act as an RFID smartcard and interact with a nearby reader for payment.The'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='SEC. 1.2 TYPES OF COMPUTER NETWORKS 11driving forces behind this phenomenon are the mobile device makers and networkoperators, who are trying hard to figure out howtoget a piece of the e-commercepie. Fromthe store’spoint of view, this scheme may save them most of the creditcard company’sfee, which can be several percent.Of course, this plan may back-fire, since customers in a store might use the RFID or barcode readers on theirmobile devices to check out competitors’ prices before buying and use them to getadetailed report on where else an item can be purchased nearby and at what price.One huge thing that m-commerce has going for it is that mobile phone usersare accustomed to paying for everything (in contrast to Internet users, who expecteverything to be free).If an Internet Web site charged a fee to allowits customersto pay by credit card, there would be an immense bellowing from the users.If,however, a mobile phone operator let its customers pay for items in a store bywaving the phone at the cash register and then tacks on a small fee for this con-venience, it would probably be accepted as normal.Time will tell.The uses of mobile and wireless computers will growrapidly in the future asthe size of computers shrinks, probably in ways no one can nowforesee. Letustakeaquick look at some possibilities.Sensor networkshave nodes that gatherand relay information theysense about the state of the physical world. Thenodesmay be embedded in familiar devices such as cars or phones, or theymay be smallseparate devices. For example, your car might gather data on its location, speed,vibration, and fuel efficiencyfrom its on-board diagnostic system and upload thisinformation to a database (Hull et al., 2006).Those data can help find potholes,plan trips around congested roads, and tell you if you are a ‘‘gas guzzler’’com-pared to other drivers on the same stretch of road.Sensor networks are revolutionizing science by providing a wealth of data onbehavior that could not previously be observed. Oneexample is tracking themigration of individual zebras by placing a small sensor on each animal (Juang etal., 2002).Researchers have packed a wireless computer into a single square cubicmillimeter (Warnekeetal., 2001).With mobile computers this small, evensmallbirds, rodents, and insects can be tracked.Wireless parking meters can accept credit or debit card payments with instantverification overthe wireless link.Theycan also report when theyare in use,which can let drivers download a recent parking map to their car so theycan findan available spot more easily.Ofcourse, when a meter expires, it might also checkfor the presence of a car (by bouncing a signal offit) and report the expiration toparking enforcement.It has been estimated that city governments in the U.S. alonecould collect an additional $10 billion this way (Harte et al., 2000).1.2.3 ContentProvider NetworksManyInternet services are nowserved from ‘‘the cloud,’’ oradata-center net-work.Modern data center networks have hundreds of thousands or millions ofservers in a single location, usually in a very dense configuration of rows of racks'),\n",

Data center networks servetheincreasingly growing demands ofcloud computingand are designed to movelarge amounts of data between servers in the data center,aswell as between thedata center and the rest of the Internet.Today,manyofthe applications and services you use, ranging from the Websites you visit to the cloud-based document editor you use to takenotes, store datain a data center network. Datacenter networks face challenges of scale, both fornetwork throughput and for energy usage. One of the main network throughputchallenges is the so-called ‘‘cross-section bandwidth,’’ which is the data rate thatcan be delivered between anytwo servers in the network. Early data-center net-work designs were based on a simple tree topology,with three layers of switches:access, aggregate, and core; this simple design did not scale well, and was also tobe subject to faults.Manypopular Internet services need to delivercontent to users around theworld. Todoso, manysites and services on the Internet use aCDN(ContentDelivery Network). ACDN is a large collection of servers that are geographicallydistributed in such a way that content is placed as close as possible to the users thatare requesting it.Large content providers such as Google, Facebook, and Netflixoperate their own CDNs. Some CDNs, such as Akamai and Cloudflare, offer host-ing services to smaller services that do not have their own CDN.Content that users want to access, ranging from static files to streaming video,may be replicated in manylocations across a single CDN. When a user requestscontent, the CDN must decide which replica it should servetothat user.This proc-ess must consider the distance from each replica to the client, the load on eachCDN server,and trafficload and congestion on the network itself.1.2.4 Transit NetworksInternet travels overmanyindependently operated networks. The network runby your Internet service provider is typically not the same network as the one thathosts the content for the Web sites that you commonly visit. Typically,content andapplications are hosted in data-center networks, and you may be accessing thatcontent from an access network. Content must thus traverse the Internet from thedata center to the access network, and ultimately to your device.When the content provider and yourISP(Internet Service Provider)are notdirectly connected, theyoften rely on atransit networkto carry the trafficbe-tween them. Transit networks typically charge both the ISP and the content pro-vider for carrying trafficfrom end-to-end.If the network hosting the content andthe access network exchange enough trafficbetween them, theymay decide tointerconnect directly.One example where direct interconnection is common is be-tween large ISPs and large content providers, such as Google or Netflix. In thesecases, the ISP and the content provider must build and maintain network infrastruc-ture to facilitate interconnecting directly,often in manygeographic locations.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='SEC. 1.2 TYPES OF COMPUTER NETWORKS 13Transit networks are traditionally calledbackbone networksbecause theyhave had the role of carrying trafficbetween twoendpoints. Manyyears ago, tran-sit networks were hugely profitable because every other network would rely onthem (and pay them) to connect to the rest of the Internet.The last decade, however, has witnessed twotrends. The first trend is the con-solidation of content in a handful of large content providers, spawned by the prolif-eration of cloud-hosted services and large content delivery networks. The secondtrend is the expansion of the footprint of individual access ISP networks: whereasaccess ISPs may have once been small and regional, manyaccess ISPs have na-tional (or eveninternational) footprints, which has increased both the range of geo-graphic locations where theycan connect to other networks as well as their sub-scriber base. As the size (and negotiating power) of the access networks and thecontent provider networks continues to increase, the larger networks have come torely less on transit networks to delivertheir traffic, preferring often to directlyinterconnect and rely on the transit network only as a backup.1.2.5 Enterprise NetworksMost organizations (e.g., companies, universities) have manycomputers. Eachemployee may use a computer to perform tasks ranging from product design topayroll. Inthe common case, these machines are connected on a common net-work, which allows the employees to share data, information, and compute re-sources with one another.Resource sharingmakes programs, equipment, and especially data availableto other users on the network without regard to the physical location of the re-source or the user.One widespread example is having a group of office workersshare a common printer.Manyemployees do not need a private printer and ahigh-volume networked printer is often less expensive,faster,and easier to main-tain than a large collection of individual printers.Probably,evenmore important than sharing physical resources such as printersand backup systems is sharing information.Most companies have customerrecords, product information, inventories, financial statements, tax information,and much more online.If all of its computers suddenly went down, a bank couldnot last more than fiveminutes. Amodern manufacturing plant, with a com-puter-controlled assembly line, would not last evenfiveseconds. Even a smalltravelagencyorthree-person lawfirm is nowhighly dependent on computer net-works for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents in-stantly.Forsmaller companies, the computers may be located in a single office evenasingle building; in the case of larger companies, the computers and employees maybe scattered overdozens of offices and plants in manycountries. Nevertheless, asalesperson in NewYork might sometimes need access to a product inventory data-base in Singapore. Networks calledVPNs(Virtual Private Networks)connect'),\n",

Inother words,the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km awayfrom his data should notprevent him from using the data as though theywere local.This goal may be sum-marized by saying that it is an attempt to end the ‘‘tyrannyofgeography.’’In the simplest of terms, one can imagine a company’sinformation system asconsisting of one or more databases with companyinformation and some numberof employees who need to access them remotely.Inthis model, the data are storedon powerful computers calledservers.Often, these are centrally housed and main-tained by a system administrator.Incontrast, the employees have simpler ma-chines, calledclients,ontheir desks, with which theyaccess remote data, for ex-ample, to include in spreadsheets theyare constructing.(Sometimes we will referto the human user of the client machine as the ‘‘client,’’ but it should be clear fromthe context whether we mean the computer or its user.) Theclient and server ma-chines are connected by a network, as illustrated in Fig.1-1. Notethat we haveshown the network as a simple oval, without anydetail. Wewill use this formwhen we mean a network in the most abstract sense.When more detail is required,it will be provided.Asecond goal of setting up an enterprise computer network has to do withpeople rather than information or evencomputers. Acomputer network can pro-vide a powerfulcommunication mediumamong employees. Virtually everycompanythat has twoormore computers nowhasemail(electronic mail), whichemployees generally use for a great deal of daily communication.In fact, a com-mon gripe around the water cooler is howmuch email everyone has to deal with,much of it quite meaningless because bosses have discovered that theycan sendthe same (often content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a but-ton.Telephone calls between employees may be carried by the computer networkinstead of by the phone company. This technology is calledIP telephonyorVoIP(Voice overIP)when Internet technology is used. The microphone and speaker ateach end may belong to a VoIP-enabled phone or the employee’scomputer.Com-panies find this a wonderful way to save ontheir telephone bills.Other,much richer forms of communication are made possible by computernetworks. Video can be added to audio so that multiple employees at distant loca-tions can see and hear each other as theyhold a meeting.This technique is a pow-erful tool for eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel.Desktopsharinglets remote workers see and interact with a graphical computer screen.This makes it easy for twoormore people who work far apart to read and write ashared blackboard or write a report together.When one worker makes a change toan online document, the others can see the change immediately,instead of waitingseveral days for a letter.Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flunggroups of people easy where it previously had been impossible.More ambitiousforms of remote coordination such as telemedicine are only nowstarting to be used(e.g., remote patient monitoring) but may become much more important.It is'),\n",

Thisreduces the need for large inventories and enhances efficiency.1.3 NETWORK TECHNOLOGY,FROMLOCAL TOGLOBALNetworks can range from small and personal to large and global. In this sec-tion, we explore the various networking technologies that implement networks atdifferent sizes and scales.1.3.1 Personal Area NetworksPANs(Personal Area Networks)let devices communicate overthe range of aperson. Acommon example is a wireless network that connects a computer withits peripherals. Other examples include the network that connects your wirelessheadphones and your watch to your smartphone.It is also often used to connect aheadset to a mobile phone without cords, and it can allowyour digital music playerto connect to your car merely being brought within range.Almost every computer has an attached monitor,keyboard, mouse, and printer.Without using wireless, this connection must be done with cables.Manynewusers have somuch trouble finding the right cables and plugging them into theright little holes (eventhough theyare usually shape and color coded) that mostcomputer vendors offer the option of sending a technician to the user’shome to doit. Tohelp these users, some companies got together to design a short-range wire-less network calledBluetoothto connect these components without wires.Theidea is that if your devices have Bluetooth, then you do not need to deal withcables. You just put them down, turn them on, and theybegin communicating.Formanypeople, this ease of operation is a big plus.In the simplest form, Bluetooth networks use the master-slave paradigm shownin Fig.1-6. Thesystem unit (the PC) is normally the master,talking to the mouseor keyboard as slaves. Themaster tells the slaveswhat addresses to use, when theycan transmit, howlong theycan transmit, what frequencies theycan use, and so on.We will discuss Bluetooth in more detail in Chap. 4.PANs can also be built with a variety of other technologies that communicateovershort ranges, as we will discuss in Chap. 4.'),\n",

Thisdevice relays packets between the wirelesscomputers and also between them and the Internet.Being the AP is likebeing thepopular kid at school because everyone wants to talk to you.Another commonscenario entails nearby devices relaying packets for one another in a so-calledmesh networkconfiguration. Insome cases, the relays are the same nodes as theendpoints; more commonly,however, a mesh network will include a separate col-lection of nodes whose sole responsibility is relaying traffic. Mesh network set-tings are common in developing regions where deploying connectivity across a re-gion may be cumbersome or costly.Theyare also becoming increasingly popularfor home networks, particularly in large homes.There is a popular standard for wireless LANs calledIEEE 802.11,commonlycalled WiFi .It runs at speeds from 11 Mbps (802.11b) to 7 Gbps (802.11ad).Please note that in this book we will adhere to tradition and measure line speeds inmegabits/sec, where 1 Mbps is 1,000,000 bits/sec, and gigabits/sec, where 1 Gbpsis 1,000,000,000 bits/sec. Powers of twoare used only for storage, where a 1 MBmemory is 220or 1,048,576 bytes.We will discuss 802.11 in Chap. 4.'),\n",

(a) 802.11. (b) Switched Ethernet.Wired LANs use manydifferent transmission technologies; common physicalmodes of transmission are copper,coaxial cable, and optical fiber.LANs have lim-ited size, which means that the worst-case transmission time is bounded and knownin advance. Knowing these bounds helps with the task of designing network proto-cols. Typically,wired LANs can run at speeds ranging from 100 Mbps to 40 Gbps.Theyalso have low latency(nevermore than tens of milliseconds, and often muchless) and transmission errors are infrequent.Wired LANs typically have lower la-tency, lower packet loss, and higher throughput than wireless LANs, but overtimethis performance gap has narrowed. Itis far easier to send signals overawire orthrough a fiber than through the air.Manywired LANs comprise point-to-point wired links.IEEE 802.3, popularlycalledEthernet,isbyfar the most common type of wired LAN.Fig. 1-7(b)showsan exampleswitched Ethernettopology.Each computer speaks the Ethernet pro-tocol and connects to a device called aswitchwith a point-to-point link.The jobof the switch is to relay packets between computers that are attached to it, using theaddress in each packet to determine which computer to send it to.Aswitch has multipleports,each of which can connect to one other device,such as a computer or evenanother switch.To build larger LANs, switches can beplugged into each other using their ports.What happens if you plug them togetherin a loop? Will the network still work? Luckily,someone thought of this case, andnowall switches in the world use her anti-looping algorithm (Perlman, 1985).It isthe job of the protocol to sort out what paths packets should traveltosafely reachthe intended computer.Wewill see howthis works in Chap. 4.It is also possible to divide one large physical LAN into twosmaller logicalLANs. You might wonder whythis would be useful. Sometimes, the layout of thenetwork equipment does not match the organization’sstructure. For example, theengineering and finance departments of a companymight have computers on thesame physical LAN because theyare in the same wing of the building, but it mightbe easier to manage the system if engineering and finance logically each had its'),\n",

Inthis design, each port is tagged with a‘‘color,’’say green for engineering and red for finance. Theswitch then forwardspackets so that computers attached to the green ports are separated from the com-puters attached to the red ports. Broadcast packets sent on a red port, for example,will not be receivedonagreen port, just as though there were twoseparate physi-cal LANs.We will coverVLANs at the end of Chap. 4.There are other wired LAN topologies, too.In fact, switched Ethernet is amodern version of the original Ethernet design that broadcasts all packets overasingle linear cable.At most one machine could successfully transmit at a time, andadistributed arbitration mechanism was used to resolveconflicts. Itused a simplealgorithm: computers could transmit wheneverthe cable was idle.If twoormorepackets collided, each computer just waited a random time and tried later.Wewillcall that versionclassic Ethernetfor clarity,and as you no doubt suspected, youwill learn about it in Chap. 4.Both wireless and wired broadcast LANs can allocate resources statically ordynamically.Atypical static allocation would be to divide time into discrete inter-vals and use a round-robin algorithm, allowing each machine to broadcast onlywhen its time slot comes up.Static allocation wastes channel capacity when a ma-chine has nothing to transmit or receive during its allocated slot, so most systemsattempt to allocate the channel dynamically (i.e., on demand).Dynamic allocation methods for a common channel are either centralized ordecentralized. Inacentralized channel allocation method, there is a single entity,for example, the base station in cellular networks, which determines who goesnext. Itmight do so by accepting multiple packets and prioritizing them accordingto some internal algorithm.In a decentralized channel allocation method, there isno central entity; each machine must decide for itself whether to transmit.Youmight think that this approach would lead to chaos, but later we will study manyalgorithms designed to bring order out of the potential chaos—provided, of course,that all the machines obeythe rules.1.3.3 HomeNetworksIt is worth giving specific attention to LANs in the home, orhome networks.Home networks are a type of LAN; theymay have a broad, diverse range of Inter-net-connected devices, and must be particularly easy to manage, dependable, andsecure, especially in the hands of nontechnical users.Manyyears ago, a home network would probably have consisted of a fewlap-tops on a wireless LAN. Today,ahome network may include devices such assmartphones, wireless printers, thermostats, burglar alarms, smokedetectors, light-bulbs, cameras, televisions, stereos, smart speakers, refrigerators, and so on.Theproliferation of Internet-connected appliances and consumer electronics, often call-ed the Internet of things, makes it possible to connect just about anyelectronic'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='SEC. 1.3NETWORK TECHNOLOGY,FROMLOCAL TOGLOBAL 19device (including sensors of manytypes) to the Internet.This huge scale and di-versity of Internet connected devices introduces newchallenges for designing,managing, and securing a home network. Remotemonitoring of the home isbecoming increasingly common, with applications ranging from security moni-toring to maintenance to aging in place, as manygrown children are willing tospend some moneytohelp their aging parents live safely in their own homes.Although the home network is just another LAN, in practice it is likely to havedifferent properties than other LANs, for several reasons.First, the devices thatpeople connect to their home network need to be easy to install and maintain.Wireless routers were at one point very commonly returned to stores because peo-ple bought them expecting to have a wireless network work ‘‘out of the box’’butinstead found themselves confronted with the prospect of manycalls to technicalsupport. The devices need to be foolproof and work without requiring the user toread and fully understand a 50-page manual.Second, security and reliability have higher stakes because insecurity of the de-vices may introduce direct threats to consumer health and safety.Losing a fewfiles to an email virus is one thing; having a burglar disarm your security systemfrom his phone and then plunder your house is something quite different. The pastfewyears have seen countless examples of insecure or malfunctioning IoT devicesthat have resulted in everything from frozen pipes to remote control of devicesthrough malicious third-party scripts.The lack of serious security on manyofthese devices has made it possible for an eavesdropper to observedetails aboutuser activity in the home; evenwhen the contents of the communication are en-crypted, simply knowing the type of device that is communicating and the volumesand times of trafficcan reveal a lot about private user behavior.Third, home networks evolveorganically,aspeople buy various consumerelectronics devices and connect them to the network. As a result, in contrast to amore homogeneous enterprise LAN, the set of technologies connected to the homenetwork may be significantly more diverse. Yet, despite this diversity,peopleexpect these devices to be able to interact(e.g., theywant to be able to use thevoice assistant manufactured by one vendor to control the lights from another ven-dor). Onceinstalled, the devices may remain connected for years (or decades).This means no interface wars: Telling consumers to buy peripherals with IEEE1394 (FireWire) interfaces and a fewyears later retracting that and saying USB 3.0is the interface-of-the-month and then switching that to 802.11g—oops, no, makethat 802.11n—no wait, 802.11ac—sorry,wemean 802.11ax, is not tenable.Finally,profit margins are small in consumer electronics, so manydevices aimto be as inexpensive aspossible. When confronted with a choice about which Inter-net-connected digital photo frame to buy,manyusers may opt for the less-expen-sive one. The pressure to reduce consumer device costs makes achieving the abovegoals evenmore difficult. Security,reliability,and interoperability all ultimatelycost money. Insome cases, manufacturers or consumers may need powerful incen-tivestomakeand stick to recognized standards.'),\n",

Convenience andcost favors wireless networking because there are no wires to fit, or worse, retrofit.As Internet-connected devices proliferate, it becomes increasingly inconvenient todrop a wired network port everywhere in the home where there is a power outlet.Wireless networks are more convenient and more cost-effective.Reliance on wire-less networks in the home, however, does introduce unique performance and secu-rity challenges. First, as users exchange more trafficontheir home networks andconnect more devices to them, the home wireless network is increasingly becom-ing a performance bottleneck. When the home network is performing poorly,acommon pastime is to blame the ISP for the poor performance.ISPs tend not tolikethis so much.Second, wireless radio wavescan travelthrough walls (in the popular 2.4 GHzband, but less so at 5 GHz).Although wireless security has improvedsubstantiallyoverthe last decade, it still has been subject to manyattacks that alloweavesdrop-ping, and certain aspects of the traffic, such as device hardware addresses and traf-ficvolume, remain unencrypted.In Chap. 8, we will study howencryption can beused to provide security,but it is easier said than done with inexperienced users.Power-line networkscan also let devices that plug into outlets broadcastinformation throughout the house.Youhaveto plug in the TV anyway,and thiswayitcan get Internet connectivity at the same time.These networks carry bothpower and data signals at the same time; part of the solution is to run these twofunctions on different frequencybands.1.3.4 Metropolitan Area NetworksAMAN(Metropolitan Area Network)covers a city.The best-known ex-amples of MANs are the cable television networks. Thesesystems grewfrom ear-lier community antenna systems used in areas with poor over-the-air televisionreception. Inthose early systems, a large antenna was placed on top of a nearbyhill and a signal was then piped to the subscribers’ houses.At first, these networks were locally designed, ad hoc systems.Then, com-panies beganjumping into the business, getting contracts from local governmentsto wire up entire cities.The next step was television programming and evenentirechannels designed for cable only.Often, these channels were highly specialized,such as all news, all sports, all cooking, all gardening, and so on.But from theirinception until the late 1990s, theywere intended for television reception only.When the Internet beganattracting a mass audience, the cable TV network op-erators begantorealize that with some changes to the system, theycould providetwo-way Internet service in unused parts of the spectrum.At that point, the cableTV system begantomorph from simply a way to distribute television to a metro-politan area network. Toafirst approximation, a MAN might look something likethe system shown in Fig.1-8. Inthis figure, we see both television signals and In-ternet being fed into the centralizedcable head-end,(or cable modem termination'),\n",

Other wireless technologies,LTE(Long Term Evolu-tion)and 5G, will also be covered there.1.3.5 Wide Area NetworksAWAN(Wide Area Network)spans a large geographical area, often a coun-try,acontinent, or evenmultiple continents. A WAN may serveaprivate organiza-tion, as in the case of an enterprise WAN, or it may be a commercial service offer-ing, as in the case of a transit network.We will begin our discussion with wired WANs, using the example of a com-panywith branch offices in different cities.The WAN in Fig.1-9 connects officesin Perth, Melbourne, and Brisbane.Each of these offices contains computers in-tended for running user (i.e., application) programs.We will followconventionalusage and call these machineshosts.The rest of the network that connects thesehosts is then called thecommunication subnet,orjustsubnetfor short.The sub-net carries messages from host to host, just as the telephone system carries words(really just sounds) from speaker to listener.In most WANs, the subnet consists of twodistinct components: transmissionlines and switching elements.Transmission linesmove bits between machines.'),\n",

Two routers that do not share a transmission line must do so viaother routers. There may be manypaths in the network that connect these tworout-ers. Howthe network makes the decision as to which path to use is called arout-ing algorithm.How each router makes the decision as to where to send a packetnext is called aforwarding algorithm.Wewill study some of both types in detailin Chap. 5.Ashort comment about the term ‘‘subnet’’isinorder here.Originally,itsonlymeaning was the collection of routers and communication lines that movedpacketsfrom the source host to the destination host.Readers should be aware that it hasacquired a second, more recent meaning in conjunction with network addressing.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 46}, page_content='SEC. 1.3NETWORK TECHNOLOGY,FROMLOCAL TOGLOBAL 23We will discuss that meaning in Chap. 5 and stick with the original meaning (a col-lection of lines and routers) until then.The WAN as we have described it looks similar to a large wired LAN, butthere are some important differences that go beyond long wires.Usually in aWAN, the hosts and subnet are owned and operated by different people.In our ex-ample, the employees might be responsible for their own computers, while thecompany’sITdepartment is in charge of the rest of the network. Wewill seeclearer boundaries in the coming examples, in which the network provider or tele-phone companyoperates the subnet.Separation of the pure communication as-pects of the network (the subnet) from the application aspects (the hosts) greatlysimplifies the overall network design.Asecond difference is that the routers will usually connect different kinds ofnetworking technology.The networks inside the offices may be switched Ethernet,for example, while the long-distance transmission lines may be SONET links(which we will coverinChap. 2). Some device needs to join them.The astutereader will notice that this goes beyond our definition of a network. Thismeansthat manyWANs will in fact beinternetworks,orcomposite networks that com-prise more than one network. Wewill have more to say about internetworks in thenext section.Afinal difference is in what is connected to the subnet.This could be individ-ual computers, as was the case for connecting to LANs, or it could be entire LANs.This is howlarger networks are built from smaller ones.As far as the subnet isconcerned, it does the same job.Virtual Private Networks and SD-WANsRather than lease dedicated transmission lines, an organization might rely onInternet connectivity to connect its offices. Thisallows connections to be made be-tween the offices as virtual links that use the underlying capacity of the Internet.As mentioned earlier,this arrangement, shown in Fig.1-10, is called a virtual pri-vate network. Incontrast to a network with dedicated physical links, a VPN hasthe usual advantage of virtualization, which is that it provides flexible reuse of aresource (Internet connectivity). AVPN also has the usual disadvantage of virtu-alization, which is a lack of control overthe underlying resources.With a dedicat-ed line, the capacity is clear.With a VPN, performance may vary with that of theunderlying Internet connectivity.The network itself may also be operated by acommercial Internet service provider (ISP).Fig. 1-11shows this structure, whichconnects the WAN sites to each other,aswell as to the rest of the Internet.Other kinds of WANs makeheavy use of wireless technologies.In satellitesystems, each computer on the ground has an antenna through which it can ex-change data with a satellite in orbit.All computers can hear the outputfromthesatellite, and in some cases, theycan also hear the upward transmissions of their'),\n",

Thefirstgeneration was analog and for voice only.The second generation was digital andfor voice only.The third generation is digital and is for both voice and data.Thefourth generation is purely digital, evenfor voice. Thefifth generation is also puredigital and much faster than the fourth, with lower delays as well.Each cellular base station covers a distance much larger than a wireless LAN,with a range measured in kilometers rather than tens of meters.The base stationsare connected to each other by a backbone network that is usually wired.The datarates of cellular networks are often on the order of 100 Mbps, much smaller than awireless LAN that can range up to on the order of 7 Gbps.We will have a lot tosay about these networks in Chap. 2.More recently,organizations that are distributed across geographic regions andneed to connect sites are designing and deploying so-calledsoftware-definedWANsorSD-WANs,which use different, complementary technologies to connectdisjoint sites but provide a singleSLA(Service-LevelAgreement)across the net-work. For example, a network might possibly use a combination of more-expensivededicated leased lines to connect multiple remote locations and complementary,'),\n",

SD-WANs are one example of anSDN(Software-Defined Network), a technology that has gained momentum overthelast decade and generally describes network architectures that control the networkusing a combination of programmable switches with control logic implemented asaseparate software program.1.3.6 InternetworksManynetworks exist in the world, and theyoften use different hardware andsoftware technologies.People connected to one network often want to communi-cate with people attached to a different one.The fulfillment of this desire requiresthat different, and frequently incompatible, networks be connected.Acollection ofinterconnected networks is called aninternetworkorinternet.Wewill use theseterms in a generic sense, in contrast to the globalInternet(which is one specificinternet), which we will always capitalize.The Internet connects content pro-viders, access networks, enterprise networks, home networks, and manyother net-works to one another.Wewill look at the Internet in great detail later in this book.Anetwork comprises the combination of a subnet and its hosts.However, theword ‘‘network’’isoften used in a loose (and confusing) sense as well.Asubnetmight be described as a network, as in the case of the ‘‘ISP network’’ofFig. 1-11.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 49}, page_content='26 INTRODUCTION CHAP.1An internetwork might also be described as a network, as in the case of the WANin Fig.1-9. Wewill followsimilar practice, and if we are distinguishing a networkfrom other arrangements, we will stick with our original definition of a collectionof computers interconnected by a single technology.An internet entails the interconnection of distinct, independently operated net-works. Inour view, connecting a LAN and a WAN or connecting twoLANs is theusual way to form an internetwork, but there is little agreement overterminology inthis area. Generally speaking, if twoormore independently operated networks payto interconnect, or if twoormore networks use fundamentally different underlyingtechnology (e.g., broadcast versus point-to-point and wired versus wireless), weprobably have aninternetwork.The device that makes a connection between twoormore networks and pro-vides the necessary translation, both in terms of hardware and software, is agate-way.Gateways are distinguished by the layer at which theyoperate in the protocolhierarchy. Wewill have much more to say about layers and protocol hierarchies inthe next section, but for nowimagine that higher layers are more tied to applica-tions, such as the Web, and lower layers are more tied to transmission links, suchas Ethernet.Because the benefit of forming an internet is to connect computers a-cross networks, we do not want to use too low-levelagatewayorwewill be unableto makeconnections between different kinds of networks. Wedonot want to usetoo high-levelagatewayeither,orthe connection will only work for particular ap-plications. Thelevelinthe middle that is ‘‘just right’’isoften called the networklayer,and a router is a gatewaythat switches packets at the network layer.Gener-ally speaking, an internetwork will be connected by network-layer gateways, orrouters; however, evenasingle large network often contains manyrouters.1.4 EXAMPLESOF NETWORKSThe subject of computer networking covers manydifferent kinds of networks,large and small, well known and less well known. Theyhavedifferent goals,scales, and technologies.In the following sections, we will look at some examples,to get an idea of the variety one finds in the area of computer networking.We will start with the Internet, probably the best-known ‘‘network,’’ and lookat its history,evolution, and technology.Then, we will consider the mobile phonenetwork. Technically,itisquite different from the Internet.Next, we will intro-duce IEEE 802.11, the dominant standard for wireless LANs.1.4.1 TheInternetThe Internet is a vast collection of different networks that use certain commonprotocols and provide certain common services.It is an unusual system in that itwasnot planned by anysingle organization, and it is not controlled by anysingle'),\n",

For a wonderful history of howthe Internet devel-oped, John Naughton’s(2000) book is highly recommended.It is one of those rarebooks that is not only fun to read but also has 20 pages ofibid.’s andop. cit.’s forthe serious historian.Some of the material in this section is based on this book.Foramore recent history,try Brian McCullough’sbook (2018).Of course, countless technical books have been written about the Internet, itshistory,and its protocols as well.Formore information, see, for example, Sever-ance (2015).The ARPANETThe story begins in the late 1950s.At the height of the Cold War,the U.S.DoD (Department of Defense) wanted a command-and-control network that couldsurvive a nuclear war.Atthat time, all military communications used the publictelephone network, which was considered vulnerable.The reason for this beliefcan be gleaned from Fig.1-12(a). Herethe black dots represent telephone switch-ing offices, each of which was connected to thousands of telephones.Theseswitching offices were, in turn, connected to higher-levelswitching offices (toll of-fices), to form a national hierarchywith only a small amount of redundancy. Thevulnerability of the system was that the destruction of a fewkey toll offices couldfragment it into manyisolated islands so that generals in the Pentagon could notcall a base in Los Angeles.\\n(a)\\nTolloffice\\nSwitchingoffice\\n(b)Figure1-12.(a) Structure of the telephone system.

Sincethe paths between anytwo switch-ing offices were nowmuch longer than analog signals could travelwithout distor-tion, Baran proposed using digital packet-switching technology.Baran wrote sev-eral reports for the DoD describing his ideas in detail (Baran, 1964).Officials atthe Pentagon liked the concept and asked AT&T,then the U.S.’national telephonemonopoly,tobuild a prototype.AT&T dismissed Baran’sideas out of hand.Thebiggest and richest corporation in the world was not about to allowsome youngwhippersnapper (out in California, no less—AT&T was then an East Coast com-pany) tell it howtobuild a telephone system.Theysaid Baran’snetwork could notbe built and the idea was killed.Several years went by and still the DoD did not have a better command-and--control system.To understand what happened next, we have togoback all the wayto October 1957, when the Soviet Union beat the U.S. into space with the launch ofthe first artificial satellite, Sputnik.When President Dwight Eisenhower tried tofind out who was asleep at the switch, he was appalled to find the Army,Navy, andAir Force squabbling overthe Pentagon’sresearch budget. Hisimmediate re-sponse was to create a single defense research organization,ARPA,theAdvancedResearch Projects Agency.ARPAhad no scientists or laboratories; in fact, it hadnothing more than an office and a small (by Pentagon standards) budget. Itdid itswork by issuing grants and contracts to universities and companies whose ideaslooked promising to it.Forthe first fewyears, ARPAtried to figure out what its mission should be.In1967, the attention of Larry Roberts, a program manager at ARPAwho was tryingto figure out howtoprovide remote access to computers, turned to networking. Hecontacted various experts to decide what to do.One of them, WesleyClark, sug-gested building a packet-switched subnet, connecting each host to its own router.After some initial skepticism, Roberts bought the idea and presented a some-what vague paper about it at the ACM SIGOPS Symposium on Operating SystemPrinciples held in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in late 1967 (Roberts, 1967).Much toRoberts’ surprise, another paper at the conference described a similar system thathad not only been designed but actually fully implemented under the direction ofDonald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory in England.The NPL systemwasnot a national system by anymeans. It just connected several computers on theNPL campus. Nevertheless, it convinced Roberts that packet switching could bemade to work. Furthermore,it cited Baran’snow discarded earlier work. Robertscame awayfrom Gatlinburgdetermined to build what later became known as theARPANET.In the plan that was developed, the subnet would consist of minicomputerscalledIMPs(Interface Message Processors)connected by then-state-of-the-art56-kbps transmission lines.Forhigh reliability,each IMP would be connected toat least twoother IMPs.Each packet sent across the subnet was to contain the fulldestination address, so if some lines and IMPs were destroyed, subsequent packetscould be automatically rerouted along alternative paths.'),\n",

Afterevaluating all the proposals, ARPAselected BBN, a consulting firm basedin Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in December 1968 awarded it a contract to buildthe subnet and write the subnet software. BBNchose to use specially modifiedHoneywell DDP-316 minicomputers with 12K 16-bit words of magnetic corememory as the IMPs.The IMPs did not have disks since moving parts were con-sidered unreliable.The IMPs were interconnected by 56-kbps lines leased fromtelephone companies.Although 56 kbps is nowoften the only choice of people inrural areas, back then, it was the best moneycould buy.The software was split into twoparts: subnet and host.The subnet softwareconsisted of the IMP end of the host-IMP connection, the IMP-IMP protocol, and asource IMP to destination IMP protocol designed to improve reliability.The origi-nal ARPANET design is shown in Fig. 1-13.Host-IMPprotocolHost-host protocol\\nSource IMP to destination IMP protocolIMP-IMP protocolIMP-IMPprotocol\\nHost\\nIMP\\nSubnet\\nFigure1-13.The original ARPANET design.Outside the subnet, software was also needed, namely,the host end of the host-IMP connection, the host-host protocol, and the application software. Itsoonbecame clear that BBN was of the opinion that when it had accepted a message onahost-IMP wire and placed it on the host-IMP wire at the destination, its job wasdone.Roberts had a problem, though: the hosts needed software too.To deal with it,he convened a meeting of network researchers, mostly graduate students, at Snow-bird, Utah, in the summer of 1969.The graduate students expected some network'),\n",

Thisallowed a researcher in the truck to useacomputer in London while driving around in California.This experiment also demonstrated that the existing ARPANET protocols werenot suitable for running overdifferent networks. Thisobservation led to more re-search on protocols, culminating with the invention of the TCP/IP protocols (Cerfand Kahn, 1974).TCP/IP was specifically designed to handle communication overinternetworks, something becoming increasingly important as more and more net-works were hooked up to the ARPANET.To encourage adoption of these newprotocols, ARPAawarded several con-tracts to implement TCP/IP on different computer platforms, including IBM, DEC,and HP systems, as well as for BerkeleyUNIX. Researchersat the University ofCalifornia at Berkeleyrewrote TCP/IP with a newprogramming interface calledsocketsfor the upcoming 4.2BSD release of BerkeleyUNIX. Theyalso wrotemanyapplication, utility,and management programs to showhow convenient itwastouse the network with sockets.The timing was perfect.Manyuniversities had just acquired a second or thirdVAXcomputer and a LAN to connect them, but theyhad no networking software.When 4.2BSD came along, with TCP/IP,sockets, and manynetwork utilities, thecomplete package was adopted immediately.Furthermore, with TCP/IP,itwaseasy for the LANs to connect to the ARPANET,and manydid. Asaresult,TCP/IP use grewrapidly during the mid-1970s.NSFNETBy the late 1970s, NSF (the U.S. National Science Foundation) sawthe enor-mous impact the ARPANET was having on university research, allowing scientistsacross the country to share data and collaborate on research projects.However, toget on the ARPANET a university had to have a research contract with the DoD.Manydid not have a contract. NSF’sinitial response was to fundCSNET(Com-puter Science Network)in1981. It connected computer science departments andindustrial research labs to the ARPANET via dial-up and leased lines.In the late1980s, the NSF went further and decided to design a successor to the ARPANETthat would be open to all university research groups.To havesomething concrete to start with, NSF decided to build a backbonenetwork to connect its six supercomputer centers, in San Diego, Boulder,Cham-paign, Pittsburgh, Ithaca, and Princeton.Each supercomputer was givenalittlebrother,consisting of an LSI-11 microcomputer called afuzzball.The fuzzballswere connected with 56-kbps leased lines and formed the subnet, the same hard-ware technology the ARPANET used.The software technology was different,however: the fuzzballs spokeTCP/IP right from the start, making it the firstTCP/IP WAN.NSF also funded some (eventually about 20) regional networks that connectedto the backbone to allowusers at thousands of universities, research labs, libraries,'),\n",

Itconnected tothe ARPANET through a link between an IMP and a fuzzball in the Carnegie-Mel-lon machine room.The first NSFNET backbone is illustrated in Fig.1-15 super-imposed on a map of the United States.\\nNSF Supercomputer centerNSF Midlevel networkBothFigure1-15.The NSFNET backbone in 1988.NSFNET was an instantaneous success and was overloaded from the word go.NSF immediately beganplanning its successor and awarded a contract to theMichigan-based MERIT consortium to run it.Fiber optic channels at 448 kbpswere leased from MCI (which was purchased by Verizon in 2006) to provide theversion 2 backbone.IBM PC-RTs were used as routers.This, too, was soon over-whelmed, and by 1990, the second backbone was upgraded to 1.5 Mbps.As growth continued, NSF realized that the government could not continuefinancing networking forever. Furthermore, commercial organizations wanted tojoin but were forbidden by NSF’scharter from using networks NSF paid for.Con-sequently,NSF encouraged MERIT,MCI, and IBM to form a nonprofit corpora-tion,ANS(Advanced Networks and Services), as the first step along the road tocommercialization. In1990, ANS took overNSFNET and upgraded the 1.5-Mbpslinks to 45 Mbps to formANSNET.This network operated for 5 years and wasthen sold to America Online.But by then, various companies were offering com-mercial IP service and it was clear that the government should nowget out of thenetworking business.To ease the transition and makesure every regional network could communi-cate with every other regional network, NSF awarded contracts to four differentnetwork operators to establish aNAP(Network Access Point). Theseoperators'),\n",

Manypeople liketocriticize the federal govern-ment for not being innovative,but in the area of networking, it was DoD and NSFthat created the infrastructure that formed the basis for the Internet and thenhanded it overtoindustry to operate.This happened because when DoD askedAT&T to build the ARPANET,itsaw novalue in computer networks and refusedto do it.During the 1990s, manyother countries and regions also built national researchnetworks, often patterned on the ARPANET and NSFNET.These includedEuropaNET and EBONE in Europe, which started out with 2-Mbps lines and thenupgraded to 34-Mbps lines.Eventually,the network infrastructure in Europe washanded overtoindustry as well.The Internet has changed a great deal since those early days.It exploded insize with the emergence of the World Wide Web (WWW) in the early 1990s.Recent data from the Internet Systems Consortium puts the number of visible In-ternet hosts at over600 million. This guess is only a low-ball estimate, but it farexceeds the fewmillion hosts that were around when the first conference on theWWW was held at CERN in 1994.The way we use the Internet has also changed radically.Initially,applicationssuch as email-for-academics, newsgroups, remote login, and file transfer domi-nated. Later,itswitched to email-for-everyman, then the Web, and peer-to-peercontent distribution, such as the now-shuttered Napster.Now real-time media dis-tribution and social media (e.g., Twitter,Facebook) are mainstays.The dominantform of trafficonthe Internet nowis, by far,streaming video (e.g., Netflix andYouTube). Thesedevelopments brought richer kinds of media to the Internet andhence much more traffic, which have also had implications for the Internet archi-tecture itself.The Internet ArchitectureThe architecture of the Internet has also changed a great deal as it has grownexplosively.Inthis section, we will attempt to give a brief overviewofwhat itlooks liketoday.The picture is complicated by continuous upheavals in the busi-nesses of telephone companies (telcos), cable companies, and ISPs that often makeit hard to tell who is doing what.One driverofthese upheavals is convergence in'),\n",

The cable network, sometimes call-ed anHFC(Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial)network, is a single integrated infrastructurethat uses a packet-based transport calledDOCSIS(Data Over Cable ServiceInterface Specification)totransmit a variety of data services, including televisionchannels, high-speed data, and voice. Thedevice at the home end is called acablemodem,and the device at thecable headendis called theCMTS(Cable ModemTermination System).

The most recent standard, DOC-SIS 3.1 full duplex, introduces support for symmetric upstream and downstreamdata rates, with a maximum capacity of 10 Gbps.Another option for last-miledeployment involves running optical fiber to residences using a technology calledFTTH(Fiber to the Home). For businesses in commercial areas, it may makesense to lease a dedicated high-speed transmission line from the offices to the near-est ISP.Inlarge cities in some parts of the world, leased lines of up to 10 Gbps areavailable; lower speeds are also available. For example, a T3 line runs at roughly45 Mbps.In other parts of the world, especially in developing regions, there is nei-ther cable nor fiber deployed; some of these regions are jumping straight to high-er-speed wireless or mobile networks as the predominant means of Internet access.We will provide an overviewofmobile Internet access in the next section.We can nowmove packets between the home and the ISP.Wecall the locationat which customer packets enter the ISP network for service the ISP’sPOP(Pointof Presence). Wewill next explain howpackets are movedbetween the POPs ofdifferent ISPs.From this point on, the system is fully digital and packet switched.ISP networks may be regional, national, or international.We havealreadyseen that their architecture includes long-distance transmission lines that intercon-nect routers at POPs in the different cities that the ISPs serve. Thisequipment iscalled thebackboneof the ISP.Ifapacket is destined for a host served directly bythe ISP,that packet is routed overthe backbone and delivered to the host.Other-wise, it must be handed overtoanother ISP.ISPs connect their networks to exchange trafficatIXPs(Internet eXchangePoints). Theconnected ISPs are said topeerwith each other.There are manyIXPs in cities around the world. Theyare drawn vertically in Fig.1-16 becauseISP networks overlap geographically.Basically,anIXP is a building full of rout-ers, at least one per ISP.Avery fast optical LAN in the room connects all the rout-ers, so packets can be forwarded from anyISP backbone to anyother ISP back-bone. IXPscan be large and independently owned facilities that compete witheach other for business. Oneof the largest is the Amsterdam Internet Exchange(AMS-IX), to which over800 ISPs connect and through which theyexchange over4000 gigabits (4 terabits) worth of trafficevery second.Peering at IXPs depends on the business relationships between ISPs.There aremanypossible relationships.Forexample, a small ISP might pay a larger ISP forInternet connectivity to reach distant hosts, much as a customer purchases servicefrom an Internet provider.Inthis case, the small ISP is said to pay fortransit.Al-ternatively,two large ISPs might decide to exchange trafficsothat each ISP candeliversome traffictothe other ISP without having to pay for transit.One of themanyparadoxes of the Internet is that ISPs who publicly compete with one anotherfor customers often privately cooperate to do peering (Metz, 2001).The path a packet takes through the Internet depends on the peering choices ofthe ISPs.If the ISP that is delivering a packet peers with the destination ISP,itmight deliverthe packet directly to its peer.Otherwise, it might route the packet to'),\n",

Two example paths across ISPs are shown in Fig.1-16. Often,the path a packet takes will not be the shortest path through the Internet.It couldbe the least congested or the cheapest for the ISPs.Asmall handful oftransit providers,including AT&T and Level3,operatelarge international backbone networks with thousands of routers connected byhigh-bandwidth fiber-optic links.These ISPs do not pay for transit.Theyareusually calledtier-1ISPs and are said to form the backbone of the Internet, sinceeveryone else must connect to them to be able to reach the entire Internet.Companies that provide lots of content, such as Facebook and Netflix, locatetheir servers indata centersthat are well-connected to the rest of the Internet.These data centers are designed for computers, not humans, and may be filled withrack upon rack of machines.Such an installation is called aserverfarm.Coloca-tionorhostingdata centers let customers put equipment such as servers at ISPPOPs so that short, fast connections can be made between the servers and the ISPbackbones. TheInternet hosting industry has become increasingly virtualized sothat it is nowcommon to rent a virtual machine that is run on a server farm insteadof installing a physical computer.These data centers are so large (hundreds ofthousands or millions of machines) that electricity is a major cost, so data centersare sometimes built in areas where electricity is cheap.Forexample, Google builta$2billion data center in The Dalles, Oregon, because it is close to a huge hydro-electric dam on the mighty Columbia Riverthat supplies it with cheap green elec-tric power.Conventionally,the Internet architecture has been viewed as a hierarchy, withthe tier-1 providers at the top of the hierarchyand other networks further down thehierarchy, depending on whether theyare large regional networks or smaller accessnetworks, as shown in Fig.1-17. Over the past decade, however, this hierarchyhasevolved and ‘‘flattened’’dramatically,asshown in Fig.1-18. Theimpetus for thisshakeup has been the rise of ‘‘hyper-giant’’content providers, including Google,Netflix, Twitch, and Amazon, as well as large, globally distributed CDNs such asAkamai, Limelight, and Cloudflare.Theyhavechanged the Internet architectureonce again. Whereasin the past, these content providers would have had to rely ontransit networks to delivercontent to local access ISPs, both the access ISPs andthe content providers have proliferated and become so large that theyoften connectdirectly to one another in manydistinct locations. In manycases, the common In-ternet path will be directly from your access ISP to the content provider.Insomecases, the content provider will evenhost servers inside the access ISP’snetwork.1.4.2 MobileNetworksMobile networks have more than fivebillion subscribers worldwide. Toputthis number in perspective,itisroughly 65% of the world’spopulation. Many, ifnot most, of these subscribers have Internet access using their mobile device (ITU,'),\n",

In 2018, mobile Internet trafficbecame more than half of global online traf-fic. Consequently,studying the mobile phone system is up next.Mobile Network ArchitectureThe architecture of the mobile phone network is very different than that of theInternet. Ithas several parts, as shown in the simplified version of the 4G LTE ar-chitecture in Fig.1-19. Thisis one of the more common mobile network standardsand will continue to be until it is replaced by 5G, the fifth generation network. Wewill discuss the history of the various generations shortly.First, there is theE-UTRAN(Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Net-work)which is a fancyname for the radio communication protocol that is usedoverthe air between the mobile device (e.g., the cell phone) and thecellular basestation,which is nowcalled aneNodeB.UMTS(Universal Mobile Telecommu-nications System)isthe formal name for the cellular phone network. Advances inthe air interface overthe past decades have greatly increased wireless data rates(and are still increasing them).The air interface is based onCDMA(Code Divi-sion Multiple Access), a technique that we will study in Chap. 2.'),\n",

Thecon-troller node orRNC(Radio Network Controller)controls howthe spectrum isused. Thebase station implements the air interface.The rest of the mobile phone network carries the trafficfor the radio accessnetwork. Itis called thecorenetwork.In4Gnetworks, the core network becamepacket-switched, and is nowcalled theEPC(Evolved Packet Core). The3GUMTS core network evolved from the core network used for the 2G GSM systemthat came before it; the 4G EPC completed the transition to a fully packet-switchedcore network. The5G system is also fully digital, too. There is no going back now.Analog is as dead as the dodo.Data services have become a much more important part of the mobile phonenetwork than theyused to be, starting with text messaging and early packet dataservices such asGPRS(General Packet Radio Service)inthe GSM system.These older data services ran at tens of kbps, but users wanted evenhigher speeds..Newer mobile phone networks support rates of multiple Mbps. For comparison, avoice call is carried at a nominal rate of 64 kbps, typically 3–4x less with compres-sion.To carry all of this data, the UMTS core network nodes connect directly to apacket-switched network. TheS-GW(Serving Network Gateway)and theP-GW(Packet Data Network Gateway)deliverdata packets to and from mobilesand interface to external packet networks such as the Internet.'),\n",

Internetprotocols are evenused on mobiles to set up connections for voice calls overapacket data network, in the manner of voice overIP. IPand packets are used all thewayfrom the radio access through to the core network. Ofcourse, the way that IPnetworks are designed is also changing to support better quality of service. If it didnot, then problems with chopped-up audio and jerkyvideo would not impress pay-ing customers.We will return to this subject in Chap. 5.Another difference between mobile phone networks and the conventional Inter-net is mobility.When a user movesout of the range of one cellular base station andinto the range of another one, the flowofdata must be re-routed from the old to thenewcell base station.

This way of doing a handoveriscalled asoft handovertodistinguish it from ahard handover,inwhich the mobile disconnects from the oldbase station before connecting to the newone.Arelated issue is howtofind a mobile in the first place when there is an in-coming call. Each mobile phone network has aHSS(Home Subscriber Server)inthe core network that knows the location of each subscriber,aswell as other profileinformation that is used for authentication and authorization.In this way,eachmobile can be found by contacting the HSS.Afinal area to discuss is security.Historically,phone companies have takensecurity much more seriously than Internet companies because theyneeded to billfor service and avoid (payment) fraud.Unfortunately,that is not saying much.Nevertheless, in the evolution from 1G through 5G technologies, mobile phonecompanies have been able to roll out some basic security mechanisms for mobiles.Starting with the 2G GSM system, the mobile phone was divided into a hand-set and a removable chip containing the subscriber’sidentity and account infor-mation. Thechip is informally called aSIM card,short forSubscriber IdentityModule.SIM cards can be switched to different handsets to activate them, andtheyprovide a basis for security.When GSM customers traveltoother countries onvacation or business, theyoften bring their handsets but buy a newSIM card forfewdollars upon arrivalinorder to makelocal calls with no roaming charges.To reduce fraud, information on SIM cards is also used by the mobile phonenetwork to authenticate subscribers and check that theyare allowed to use the net-work. With UMTS, the mobile also uses the information on the SIM card to checkthat it is talking to a legitimate network.Privacy isanother important consideration.Wireless signals are broadcast toall nearby receivers, so to makeitdifficult to eavesdrop on conversations, crypto-graphic keysonthe SIM card are used to encrypt transmissions.This approachprovides much better privacy than in 1G systems, which were easily tapped, but isnot a panacea due to weaknesses in the encryption schemes.Packet Switching and Circuit SwitchingSince the beginning of networking, a war has been going on between the peo-ple who support packet-switched networks (which are connectionless) and the peo-ple who support circuit-switched networks (which are connection-oriented).Themain proponents ofpacket switchingcome from the Internet community.Inaconnectionless design, every packet is routed independently of every other packet.As a consequence, if some routers go down during a session, no harm will be doneas long as the system can dynamically reconfigure itself so that subsequent packetscan find some other route to the destination, evenifitisdifferent from that which'),\n",

Thesender will eventually notice this and resend the data, but thequality of service may be poor unless the applications account for this variability.Thecircuit switchingcamp comes from the world of telephone companies.Inthe telephone system, a caller must dial the called party’snumber and wait for aconnection before talking or sending data.This connection setup establishes aroute through the telephone system that is maintained until the call is terminated.All words or packets followthe same route.If a line or switch on the path goesdown, the call is aborted, making it less fault tolerant than a connectionless design.Circuit switching can support quality of service more easily.Bysetting up aconnection in advance, the subnet can reservelink bandwidth, switch buffer space,and CPU time.If an attempt is made to set up a call and insufficient resources areavailable, the call is rejected and the caller gets a kind of busy signal.In this way,once a connection has been set up, the connection will get good service.The surprise in Fig.1-19 is that there is both packet- and circuit-switchedequipment in the core network. This shows that the mobile phone network is intransition, with mobile phone companies able to implement one or sometimes bothof the alternatives. Oldermobile phone networks used a circuit-switched core inthe style of the traditional phone network to carry voice calls. This legacy isseen inthe UMTS network with theMSC(Mobile Switching Center),GMSC(GatewayMobile Switching Center), andMGW(Media Gateway)elements that set upconnections overacircuit-switched core network such as thePSTN(PublicSwitched Telephone Network).Early Generation Mobile Networks: 1G, 2G, and 3GThe architecture of the mobile network has changed greatly overthe past 50years along with its tremendous growth. First-generationmobile phone systemstransmitted voice calls as continuously varying (analog) signals rather than se-quences of (digital) bits.AMPS(Advanced Mobile Phone System), which wasdeployed in the United States in 1982, was a widely used first-generation system.Second-generation mobile phone systems switched to transmitting voice calls indigital form to increase capacity,improve security,and offer text messaging.GSM(Global System for Mobile communications), which was deployed starting in1991 and has become widely used worldwide. Itis a 2G system.The third generation, or 3G, systems were initially deployed in 2001 and offerboth digital voice and broadband digital data services.Theyalso come with a lotof jargon and manydifferent standards to choose from.3G is loosely defined bythe ITU (an international standards body we will discuss later on in this chapter))as providing rates of at least 2 Mbps for stationary or walking users and 384 kbpsin a moving vehicle. UMTSis the main 3G system that is deployed worldwide. Itis also the basis for its various successors.It can provide up to 14 Mbps on the'),\n",

Inthe United Kingdom in 2000, forexample, five3G licenses were auctioned for a total of about $40 billion.It is the scarcity of spectrum that led to thecellular networkdesign shown inFig. 1-21that is nowused for mobile phone networks. Tomanage the radio inter-ference between users, the coverage area is divided into cells.Within a cell, usersare assigned channels that do not interfere with each other and do not cause toomuch interference for adjacent cells.This allows for good reuse of the spectrum,orfrequency reuse,inthe neighboring cells, which increases the capacity of thenetwork. In1G systems, which carried each voice call on a specific frequencyband, the frequencies were carefully chosen so that theydid not conflict withneighboring cells.In this way,agivenfrequencymight only be reused once in sev-eral cells.Modern 3G systems alloweach cell to use all frequencies, but in a waythat results in a tolerable levelofinterference to the neighboring cells.There arevariations on the cellular design, including the use of directional or sectored anten-nas on cell towers to further reduce interference, but the basic idea is the same.Cells Base station\\nFigure1-21.Cellular design of mobile phone networks.ModernMobile Networks: 4G and 5GMobile phone networks are destined to play a big role in future networks.

The4G, later 4G (LTE(Long Term Evolution) technologies offer faster speeds, emerged in the late 2000s.4G LTE networks very quickly became the predominant mode of mobile Inter-net access in the late 2000s, outpacing competitors like802.16, sometimes calledWiMAX.5Gtechnologies are promising faster speeds—up to 10 Gbps—and arenowset for large-scale deployment in the early 2020s. One of the main distinctionsbetween these technologies is the frequencyspectrum that theyrely on.Forex-ample, 4G uses frequencybands up to 20 MHz; in contrast, 5G is designed to oper-ate in much higher frequencybands, of up to 6 GHz. The challenge when movingto higher frequencies is that the higher frequencysignals do not travelasfar aslower frequencies, so the technology must account for signal attenuation, inter-ference, and errors using newer algorithms and technologies, including multipleinput multiple output (MIMO) antenna arrays.The short microwavesatthese fre-quencies are also absorbed easily by water,requiring special efforts to have themwork when it is raining.1.4.3 Wireless Networks (WiFi)Almost as soon as laptops appeared, manypeople dreamed of walking into anoffice and magically having their laptop computer be connected to the Internet.Various groups worked for years to accomplish this goal.The most practical ap-proach is to equip both the office and the laptop computers with short-range radiotransmitters and receivers to allowthem to talk.Work in this field rapidly led to wireless LANs being marketed by a variety ofcompanies. Thetrouble was that no twoofthem were compatible.The prolifera-tion of standards meant that a computer equipped with a brandXradio would notwork in a room equipped with a brandYbase station.In the mid 1990s, the indus-try decided that a wireless LAN standard might be a good idea, so the IEEE com-mittee that had standardized wired LANs was giventhe task of drawing up a wire-less LAN standard.The first decision was the easiest: what to call it.All the other LAN standardsproduced by IEEE’s802 standards committee had numbers like802.1, 802.2, and802.3, up to 802.10, so the wireless LAN standard was dubbed 802.11.Truly bril-liant. Acommon slang name for it isWiFi,but it is an important standard anddeserves respect, so we will call it by its more formal name, 802.11. Manyvariantsand versions of the 802.11 standard have emerged and evolved overthe years.After settling on the name, the rest was harder.The first problem was to find asuitable frequencyband that was available, preferably worldwide. The approachtaken was the opposite of that used in mobile phone networks. Insteadof expen-sive,licensed spectrum, 802.11 systems operate in unlicensed bands such as theISM(Industrial, Scientific, and Medical)bands defined by ITU-R (e.g.,902-928 MHz,2.4-2.5 GHz,5.725-5.825 GHz).All devices are allowed to use this'),\n",

Ofcourse, this means that 802.11 radios may find themselves competing withcordless phones, garage door openers, and microwave ovens. Sounless designersthink people want to call to their garage doors, it is important to get this right.802.11 networks have clients, such as laptops and mobile phones, as well asinfrastructure calledAPs(access points)that is installed in buildings. Accesspoints are sometimes calledbase stations.The access points connect to the wirednetwork, and all communication between clients goes through an access point.Itis also possible for clients that are in radio range to talk directly,such as twocom-puters in an office without an access point.This arrangement is calledanad hocnetwork.Itisused much less often than the access point mode.Both modes areshown in Fig. 1-22.\\n(a) (b)\\nTo wired networkAccesspoint\\nFigure1-22.(a) Wireless network with an access point. (b) Ad hoc network.802.11 transmission is complicated by wireless conditions that vary with evensmall changes in the environment. Atthe frequencies used for 802.11, radio sig-nals can be reflected offsolid objects so that multiple echoes of a transmission mayreach a receiveralong different paths. The echoes can cancel or reinforce eachother,causing the receivedsignal to fluctuate greatly.This phenomenon is calledmultipath fading,and it is shown in Fig. 1-23.The key idea for overcoming variable wireless conditions ispath diversity,orthe sending of information along multiple, independent paths.In this way,theinformation is likely to be receivedevenifone of the paths happens to be poor dueto a fade. These independent paths are typically built into the digital modulationscheme used in the hardware. Optionsinclude using different frequencies acrossthe allowed band, following different spatial paths between different pairs of anten-nas, or repeating bits overdifferent periods of time.Different versions of 802.11 have used all of these techniques.The initial(1997) standard defined a wireless LAN that ran at either 1 Mbps or 2 Mbps byhopping between frequencies or spreading the signal across the allowed spectrum.Almost immediately,people complained that it was too slow, sowork beganonfaster standards.The spread spectrum design was later extended and became the'),\n",

Itdivides a wide bandof spectrum into manynarrowslices overwhich different bits are sent in parallel.This improvedscheme, which we will study in Chap. 2, boosted the 802.11a/g bitrates up to 54Mbps. Thatis a significant increase, but people still wanted morethroughput to support more demanding uses.More recent versions of the standardoffer higher data rates.The commonly deployed 802.11ac can run at 3.5 Gbps.The newer 802.11ad can run at 7 Gbps, but only indoors within a single room sincethe radio wavesatthe frequencies it uses do not penetrate walls very well.Since wireless is inherently a broadcast medium, 802.11 radios also have todeal with the problem that multiple transmissions that are sent at the same timewill collide, which may interfere with reception.To handle this problem, 802.11uses aCSMA(Carrier Sense Multiple Access)scheme that draws on ideas fromclassic wired Ethernet, which, ironically,drewfrom an early wireless network de-veloped in Hawaii calledALOHA.Computers wait for a short random intervalbefore transmitting and defer their transmissions if theyhear that someone else isalready transmitting. This scheme makes it less likely that twocomputers will sendat the same time.It does not work as well as in the case of wired networks,though. Tosee why, examine Fig.1-24. Supposethat computerAis transmittingto computerB,but the radio range ofA’s transmitter is too short to reach computerC.IfCwants to transmit toB,itcan listen before starting, but the fact that it doesnot hear anything does not mean that its transmission will succeed.The inabilityofCto hearAbefore starting causes some collisions to occur.After anycollision,the sender then waits another,longer,random delay and retransmits the packet.Despite this and some other issues, the scheme works well enough in practice.Mobility presents another challenge.If a mobile client is movedawayfromthe access point it is using and into the range of a different access point, some way'),\n",

Thesolution is that an 802.11 network can consist ofmultiple cells, each with its own access point, and a distribution system that con-nects the cells.The distribution system is often switched Ethernet, but it can useanytechnology.Asthe clients move,theymay find another access point with abetter signal than the one theyare currently using and change their association.From the outside, the entire system looks likeasingle wired LAN.That said, mobility in 802.11 has been of limited value so far compared tomobility in the mobile phone network. Typically,802.11 is used by nomadic cli-ents that go from one fixed location to another,rather than being used on-the-go.Mobility is not really needed for nomadic usage. Even when 802.11 mobility isused, it extends overasingle 802.11 network, which might coveratmost a largebuilding. Futureschemes will need to provide mobility across different networksand across different technologies (e.g., 802.21, which deals with the handoverbe-tween wired and wireless networks).Finally,there is the problem of security.Since wireless transmissions arebroadcast, it is easy for nearby computers to receive packets of information thatwere not intended for them.To prevent this, the 802.11 standard included an en-cryption scheme known asWEP(WiredEquivalent Privacy). Theidea was tomakewireless security likethat of wired security.Itisagood idea, but unfortun-ately,the scheme was flawed and soon broken (Borisovetal., 2001).It has sincebeen replaced with newer schemes that have different cryptographic details in the802.11i standard, calledWiFi Protected Access,initially calledWPA(WiFi Pro-tected Access)but nowreplaced byWPA2,and evenmore sophisticated protocolssuch as802.1X,which allows certificated-based authentication of the access pointto the client, as well as a variety of different ways for the client to authenticate it-self to the access point.802.11 has caused a revolution in wireless networking that is set to continue.Beyond buildings, it is nowprevalent in trains, planes, boats, and automobiles sothat people can surf the Internet wherevertheygo.

Wethen explore a central concept in network protocol design: layering.Then, we talk about connection-oriented vs. connectionless services, as well as thespecific service primitivesthat support these services.1.5.1 DesignGoalsNetwork protocols often share a common set of design goals, which includereliability (the ability to recoverfrom errors, faults, or failures); resource allocation(sharing access to a common, limited resource); evolvability (allowing for incre-mental deployment of protocol improvements overtime); and security (defendingthe network against various types of attacks). In this section, we explore each ofthese goals at a high level.ReliabilitySome of the key design issues that occur in computer networks will come up inlayer after layer.Below, wewill briefly mention the more important ones.Reliabilityis the design issue of making a network that operates correctly eventhough it is comprised of a collection of components that are themselves unre-liable. Thinkabout the bits of a packet traveling through the network. Thereis achance that some of these bits will be receiveddamaged (inverted) due to flukeelectrical noise, random wireless signals, hardware flaws, software bugs, and soon. Howisitpossible that we find and fix these errors?One mechanism for finding errors in receivedinformation uses codes forerrordetection.Information that is incorrectly receivedcan then be retransmitted untilit is receivedcorrectly.More powerful codes allowforerror correction,wherethe correct message is recovered from the possibly incorrect bits that were origi-nally received. Bothof these mechanisms work by adding redundant information.Theyare used at lowlayers, to protect packets sent overindividual links, and highlayers, to check that the right contents were received.Another reliability issue is finding a working path through a network. Often,there are multiple paths between a source and destination, and in a large network,'),\n",

Suppose for example, that thenetwork is down in Berlin.Packets sent from London to Rome via Berlin will notget through, but we could instead send packets from London to Rome via Paris.The network should automatically makethis decision.This topic is calledrouting.Resource AllocationAsecond design issue is resource allocation.When networks get large, newproblems arise. Cities can have trafficjams, a shortage of telephone numbers, andit is easy to get lost.Not manypeople have these problems in their own neighbor-hood, but citywide theymay be a big issue.Designs that continue to work wellwhen the network gets large are said to bescalable.Networks provide a service tohosts using their underlying resources, such as the capacity of transmission lines.To dothis well, theyneed mechanisms that divide their resources so that one hostdoes not interfere with another too much.Manydesigns share network bandwidth dynamically,according to the short-term needs of hosts, rather than by giving each host a fixed fraction of the band-width that it may or may not use.This design is calledstatistical multiplexing,meaning sharing based on the statistics of demand.It can be applied at lowlayersfor a single link, or at high layers for a network or evenapplications that use thenetwork.An allocation problem that occurs at every levelishow tokeep a fast senderfrom swamping a slowreceiverwith data.Feedback from the receivertothe send-er is often used.This subject is calledflowcontrol.Sometimes the problem isthat the network is oversubscribed because too manycomputers want to send toomuch traffic, and the network cannot deliveritall. Thisoverloading of the networkis calledcongestion.One strategy is for each computer to reduce its demand forresources (e.g., bandwidth) when it experiences congestion. It, too, can be used inall layers.It is interesting to observethat the network has more resources to offer thansimply bandwidth.Foruses such as carrying live video, the timeliness of deliverymatters a great deal. Most networks must provide service to applications that wantthisreal-timedelivery at the same time that theyprovide service to applicationsthat want high throughput.Quality of serviceis the name giventomechanismsthat reconcile these competing demands.EvolvabilityAnother design issue concerns the evolution of the network. Over time, net-works growlarger and newdesigns emerge that need to be connected to the exist-ing network.

Thismechanism is calledaddressingornaming,inthe lowand high layers,respectively.An aspect of growth is that different network technologies often have differentlimitations. For example, not all communication channels preservethe order ofmessages sent on them, leading to solutions that number messages.Another ex-ample is differences in the maximum size of a message that the networks can trans-mit. This leads to mechanisms for disassembling, transmitting, and then reassem-bling messages.This overall topic is calledinternetworking.SecurityThe last major design issue is to secure the network by defending it against dif-ferent kinds of threats. One of the threats we have mentioned previously is that ofeavesdropping on communications.Mechanisms that provideconfidentialitydefend against this threat, and theyare used in multiple layers.Mechanisms forauthenticationprevent someone from impersonating someone else.Theymightbe used to tell fakebanking Web sites from the real one, or to let the cellular net-work check that a call is really coming from your phone so that you will pay thebill. Othermechanisms forintegrityprevent surreptitious changes to messages,such as altering ‘‘debit my account $10’’to‘‘debit my account $1000.’’ All ofthese designs are based on cryptography, which we shall study in Chap. 8.1.5.2 Protocol LayeringTo reduce their design complexity,most networks are organized as a stack oflayersorlevels,each one built upon the one belowit. Thenumber of layers, thename of each layer,the contents of each layer,and the function of each layer differfrom network to network. Thepurpose of each layer is to offer certain services tothe higher layers while shielding those layers from the details of howthe offeredservices are actually implemented.In a sense, each layer is a kind of virtual ma-chine, offering certain services to the layer above it.This concept is actually a familiar one and is used throughout computer sci-ence, where it is variously known as information hiding, abstract data types, dataencapsulation, and object-oriented programming.The fundamental idea is that aparticular piece of software (or hardware) provides a service to its users but keepsthe details of its internal state and algorithms hidden from them.When layernon one machine carries on a conversation with layernon anothermachine, the rules and conventions used in this conversation are collectivelyknown as the layernprotocol.

Thetranslators have agreed on a neutral languageknown to both of them, Dutch, so the message is converted to ‘‘Ik vind konijnenleuk.’’ The choice of the language is the layer 2 protocol and is up to the layer 2peer processes.The translator then givesthe message to a secretary for transmission, for ex-ample, by fax (the layer 1 protocol).When the message arrivesatthe other secre-tary,itispassed to the local translator,who translates it into French and passes it a-cross the 2/3 interface to the second philosopher.Note that each protocol is com-pletely independent of the other ones as long as the interfaces are not changed.The translators can switch from Dutch to, say,Finnish, at will, provided that theyboth agree and neither changes his interface with either layer 1 or layer 3.Simi-larly,the secretaries can switch from email to telephone without disturbing (oreveninforming) the other layers.Each process may add some information intend-ed only for its peer.This information is not passed up to the layer above.Nowconsider a more technical example: howtoprovide communication to thetop layer of the five-layer network in Fig.1-27.

Thepeer processes in layer 4, for example, conceptually think of their com-munication as being ‘‘horizontal,’’ using the layer 4 protocol.Each one is likely tohave procedures called something likeSendToOtherSideandGetFromOtherSide,eventhough these procedures actually communicate with lower layers across the3/4 interface, and not with the other side.The peer process abstraction is crucial to all network design.Using it, theunmanageable task of designing the complete network can be broken into severalsmaller,manageable design problems, namely,the design of the individual layers.As a consequence, all real networks use layering.It is worth pointing out that the lower layers of a protocol hierarchyare fre-quently implemented in hardware or firmware. Nevertheless, complexprotocol al-gorithms are involved, eveniftheyare embedded (in whole or in part) in hardware.1.5.3 Connectionsand ReliabilityLayers offer twotypes of service to the layers above them: connection-orientedand connectionless. Theymay also offer various levels of reliability.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 77}, page_content='54 INTRODUCTION CHAP.1Connection-Oriented ServiceConnection-orientedservice is modeled after the telephone system.To talkto someone, you pick up the phone, key inthe number,talk, and then hang up.Similarly,touse a connection-oriented network service, the service user first estab-lishes a connection, uses the connection, and then releases the connection.The es-sential aspect of a connection is that it acts likeatube: the sender pushes objects(bits) in at one end, and the receivertakes them out at the other end.In most cases,the order is preserved so that the bits arrive inthe order theywere sent.In some cases when a connection is established, the sender,receiver, and sub-net conduct anegotiationabout the parameters to be used, such as maximum mes-sage size, quality of service required, and other issues.Typically,one side makes aproposal and the other side can accept it, reject it, or makeacounterproposal. Acircuitis another name for a connection with associated resources, such as a fixedbandwidth. This dates from the telephone network in which a circuit was a pathovercopper wire that carried a phone conversation.Connectionless ServiceIn contrast to connection-oriented service,connectionlessservice is modeledafter the postal system.Each message (letter) carries the full destination address,and each one is routed through the intermediate nodes inside the system indepen-dent of all the subsequent messages.There are different names for messages indifferent contexts; apacketis a message at the network layer.When the interme-diate nodes receive a message in full before sending it on to the next node, this iscalledstore-and-forward switching.The alternative,inwhich the onward trans-mission of a message at a node starts before it is completely receivedbythe node,is calledcut-through switching.Normally,when twomessages are sent to thesame destination, the first one sent will be the first one to arrive.However, itispossible that the first one sent can be delayed so that the second one arrivesfirst.Not all applications require connections.Forexample, spammers send elec-tronic junk mail to manyrecipients. Unreliable(meaning not acknowledged) con-nectionless service is often calleddatagramservice, in analogy with telegram ser-vice, which also does not return an acknowledgement to the sender.ReliabilityConnection-oriented and connectionless services can each be characterized bytheir reliability.Some services are reliable in the sense that theyneverlose data.Usually,areliable service is implemented by having the receiveracknowledge thereceipt of each message so the sender is sure that it arrived. Theacknowledgementprocess introduces overhead and delays, which are often worth it but sometimesthe price that has to be paid for reliability is too high.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 78}, page_content='SEC. 1.5 NETWORK PROTOCOLS 55Atypical situation when a reliable connection-oriented service is appropriate isfile transfer.The owner of the file wants to be sure that all the bits arrive correctlyand in the same order theywere sent.Very fewfile transfer customers would pre-fer a service that occasionally scrambles or loses a fewbits, evenifitwere muchfaster.Reliable connection-oriented service has twominor variations: message se-quences and byte streams.In the former variant, the message boundaries are pre-served. Whentwo1024-byte messages are sent, theyarrive astwo distinct1024-byte messages, neverasone 2048-byte message.In the latter,the connectionis simply a stream of bytes, with no message boundaries.When 2048 bytes arriveat the receiver, there is no way to tell if theywere sent as one 2048-byte message,two1024-byte messages, or 2048 1-byte messages.If the pages of a book are sentoveranetwork to a photo-typesetter as separate messages, it might be important topreservethe message boundaries.On the other hand, to download a movie, a bytestream from the server to the user’scomputer is all that is needed.Message bound-aries (different scenes) within the movie are not relevant.In some situations, the convenience of not having to establish a connection tosend one message is desired, but reliability is essential.Theacknowledged data-gramservice can be provided for these applications.It is likesending a registeredletter and requesting a return receipt.When the receipt comes back, the sender isabsolutely sure that the letter was delivered to the intended party and not lost alongthe way.Textmessaging on mobile phones is an example.The concept of using unreliable communication may be confusing at first.After all, whywould anyone actually prefer unreliable communication to reliablecommunication? Firstof all, reliable communication (in our sense, that is,acknowledged) may not be available in a givenlayer.For example, Ethernet doesnot provide reliable communication.Packets can occasionally be damaged in tran-sit. Itis up to higher protocol levels to recoverfrom this problem.In particular,manyreliable services are built on top of an unreliable datagram service.Second,the delays inherent in providing a reliable service may be unacceptable, especiallyin real-time applications such as multimedia.Forthese reasons, both reliable andunreliable communication coexist.In some applications, the transit delays introduced by acknowledgements areunacceptable. Onesuch application is digitized voice traffic(VoIP). Itis less dis-ruptive for VoIP users to hear a bit of noise on the line from time to time than toexperience a delay waiting for acknowledgements. Similarly,when transmitting avideo conference, having a fewpixels wrong is no problem, but having the imagejerk along as the flowstops and starts to correct errors, or having to wait longer foraperfect video stream to arrive,isirritating.Still another service is therequest-replyservice. Inthis service, the sendertransmits a single datagram containing a request; the reply contains the answer.Request-reply is commonly used to implement communication in the client-servermodel: the client issues a request and then the server responds to it.Forexample, a'),\n",

Thesecalls cause a trap to kernel mode, which then turns control of the ma-chine overtothe operating system to send the necessary packets.The set of primitivesavailable depends on the nature of the service being pro-vided. Theprimitivesfor connection-oriented service are different from those ofconnectionless service.As a minimal example of the service primitivesthat mightprovide a reliable byte stream, consider the primitiveslisted in Fig.1-29. Theywill be familiar to fans of the Berkeleysocket interface, as the primitivesare a sim-plified version of that interface.These primitivesmight be used for a request-reply interaction in a client-serverenvironment. Toillustrate how, wesketch a simple protocol that implements theservice using acknowledged datagrams.First, the server executesLISTENto indicate that it is prepared to accept incom-ing connections.Acommon way to implementLISTENis to makeitablockingsystem call.After executing the primitive,the server process is blocked (sus-pended) until a request for connection appears.Next, the client process executesCONNECTto establish a connection with theserver.TheCONNECTcall needs to specify who to connect to, so it might have aparameter giving the server’saddress.

This sends a response (2) back to the client process to accept theconnection. Thearrivalofthis response then releases the client.At this point, theclient and server are both running and theyhaveaconnection established.An obvious analogy between this protocol and real life is a customer (client)calling a company’scustomer service manager.Atthe start of the day,the servicemanager sits next to her telephone in case it rings. Later,aclient places a call.When the manager picks up the phone, the connection is established.The next step is for the server to executeRECEIVEto prepare to accept the firstrequest.

Usually,aninitialDISCONNECTis a blocking call, suspending the client, andsending a packet to the server saying that the connection is no longer needed.When the server gets the packet, it also issues aDISCONNECTof its own, acknowl-edging the client and releasing the connection (6).When the server’spacket getsback to the client machine, the client process is released and the connection is bro-ken. Inanutshell, this is howconnection-oriented communication works.Of course, life is not so simple.Manythings can go wrong here.The timingcan be wrong (e.g., theCONNECTis done before theLISTEN), packets can get lost,and much more.We will look at these issues in great detail later,but for the mo-ment, Fig.1-30 briefly summarizes howclient-server communication might workwith acknowledged datagrams so that we can ignore lost packets.Giventhat six packets are required to complete this protocol, one might won-der whyaconnectionless protocol is not used instead.The answer is that in a per-fect world it could be, in which case only twopackets would be needed: one for therequest and one for the reply.However, inthe face of large messages in either di-rection (e.g., a megabyte file), transmission errors, and lost packets, the situationchanges. Ifthe reply consisted of hundreds of packets, some of which could belost during transmission, howwould the client knowifsome pieces were missing?Howwould the client knowwhether the last packet actually receivedwas really thelast packet sent?Suppose the client wanted a second file. Howcould it tell packet1from the second file from a lost packet 1 from the first file that suddenly foundits way to the client?In short, in the real world, a simple request-reply protocoloveranunreliable network is often inadequate.In Chap. 3, we will study a varietyof protocols in detail that overcome these and other problems.Forthe moment,suffice it to say that having a reliable, ordered byte stream between processes issometimes very convenient.1.5.5 TheRelationship of Services to ProtocolsServices and protocols are distinct concepts.This distinction is so importantthat we emphasize it again here.Aserviceis a set of primitives(operations) that alayer provides to the layer above it. Theservice defines what operations the layeris able to perform on behalf of its users, but it says nothing at all about howtheseoperations are implemented.Aservice relates to an interface between twolayers,with the lower layer being the service provider and the upper layer being the ser-vice user.The service uses the lower layer to allowthe upper layer to do its work.Aprotocol,incontrast, is a set of rules governing the format and meaning ofthe packets, or messages that are exchanged by the peer entities within a layer.Entities use protocols in order to implement their service definitions. Theyare free'),\n",

Thisarrangement meant that allchanges to the protocol were immediately visible to the users.Most network de-signers nowregard such a design as a serious blunder.1.6 REFERENCEMODELSLayered protocol design is one of the key abstractions in network design. Oneof the main questions is defining the functionality of each layer and the interac-tions between them.Twoprevailing models are the TCP/IP reference model andthe OSI reference model. Wediscuss each of them below, aswell as the model weuse for the rest of this book, which strikes a middle ground between them.1.6.1 TheOSI Reference ModelThe OSI model (minus the physical medium) is shown in Fig.1-32.

Thenumber of layers should be large enough that distinct functionsneed not be thrown together in the same layer out of necessity andsmall enough that the architecture does not become unwieldy.Three concepts are central to the OSI model:1. Services.2. Interfaces.3. Protocols.Probably,the biggest contribution of the OSI model is that it makes the distinctionbetween these three concepts explicit. Eachlayer performs someservicesfor thelayer above it. Theservice definition tells what the layer does, not howentitiesabove itaccess it or howthe layer works.The TCP/IP model did not originally clearly distinguish between services, in-terfaces, and protocols, although people have tried to retrofit it after the fact tomakeitmore OSI-like.1.6.2 TheTCP/IP Reference ModelThe TCP/IP reference model is used in the grandparent of all wide area com-puter networks, the ARPANET,and its successor,the worldwide Internet.As de-scribed earlier,the ARPANET was a research network sponsored by the DoD.Iteventually connected hundreds of universities and government installations, usingleased telephone lines.When satellite and radio networks were added later,theexisting protocols had trouble interworking with them, so a newreference architec-ture was needed.Thus, from nearly the beginning, the ability to connect multiplenetworks in a seamless way was one of the major design goals.This architecturelater became known as theTCP/IP Reference Model,after its twoprimary proto-cols. Itwasfirst described by Cerf and Kahn (1974), and later refined and definedas a standard in the Internet community (Braden, 1989).The design philosophybehind the model is discussed by Clark (1988).Giventhe DoD’sworry that some of its precious hosts, routers, and internet-work gateways might get blown to pieces at a moment’snotice by an attack fromthe Soviet Union, another major goal was that the network be able to survive theloss of subnet hardware, without existing conversations being broken off. Inotherwords, the DoD wanted connections to remain intact as long as the source anddestination machines were functioning, evenifsome of the machines or transmis-sion lines in between were suddenly put out of operation.Furthermore, since ap-plications with divergent requirements were envisioned, ranging from transferringfiles to real-time speech transmission, a flexible architecture was needed.'),\n",

Thelowest layer in themodel, thelink layer,describes what links such as serial lines and classic Ethernetmust do to meet the needs of this connectionless internet layer.Itisnot really alayer at all, in the normal sense of the term, but rather an interface between hostsand transmission links. Early material on the TCP/IP model ignored it.The Internet LayerTheinternet layeris the linchpin that holds the whole architecture together.Itis shown in Fig.1-33. Itsjob is to permit hosts to inject packets into anynetworkand have them travelindependently to the destination (potentially on a differentnetwork). Theymay evenarrive inacompletely different order than theyweresent, in which case it is the job of higher layers to rearrange them, if in-order deliv-ery is desired.Note that ‘‘internet’’isused here in a generic sense, eventhoughthis layer is present in the Internet.

Theearly ones included virtual terminal (TELNET), file trans-fer (FTP), and electronic mail (SMTP).Manyother protocols have been added tothese overthe years.Some important ones that we will study,shown in Fig.1-34,include the Domain Name System (DNS), for mapping host names onto their net-work addresses, HTTP,the protocol for fetching pages on the World Wide Web,and RTP,the protocol for delivering real-time media such as voice or movies.1.6.3 ACritique of the OSI Model and ProtocolsNeither the OSI model and its protocols nor the TCP/IP model and its proto-cols are perfect.Quite a bit of criticism can be, and has been, directed at both ofthem. Inthis section, and the next one, we will look at some of these criticisms.We will begin with OSI and examine TCP/IP afterward.At the time the second edition of this book was published (1989), it appearedto manyexperts in the field that the OSI model and its protocols were going to takeoverthe world and push everything else out of their way.This did not happen.Why? Alook back at some of the reasons may be useful.Theycan be summa-rized as: bad timing, bad design, bad implementations, and bad politics.Bad TimingFirst let us look at reason one: bad timing.The time at which a standard is es-tablished is absolutely critical to its success.David Clark of M.I.T.has a theory ofstandards that he calls theapocalypse of the two elephants,which is illustrated inFig. 1-35.\\nTime\\nActivity\\nResearch\\nStandards\\nBillion dollarinvestment\\nFigure1-35.The apocalypse of the twoelephants.This figure shows the amount of activity surrounding a newsubject. Whenthesubject is first discovered, there is a giant burst of research activity in the form of'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 88}, page_content='SEC. 1.6 REFERENCE MODELS 65research, discussions, papers, and meetings.After a while this activity subsides,corporations discoverthe subject, and the billion-dollar waveof investment hits.It is essential that the standards be written in the trough in between the two‘‘elephants.’’ Iftheyare written too early (before the research results are well es-tablished), the subject may still be poorly understood; the result is a bad standard.If theyare written too late, so manycompanies may have already made majorinvestments in different ways of doing things that the standards are effectivelyignored. Ifthe interval between the twoelephants is very short (because everyoneis in a hurry to get started), the people developing the standards may get crushed.It nowappears that the standard OSI protocols got crushed.The competingTCP/IP protocols were already in widespread use by research universities by thetime the OSI protocols appeared.While the billion-dollar waveof investment hadnot yet hit, the academic market was large enough that manyvendors had beguncautiously offering TCP/IP products.When OSI came around, theydid not want tosupport a second protocol stack until theywere forced to, so there were no initialofferings. With every companywaiting for every other companytogofirst, nocompanywent first and OSI neverhappened.Bad DesignThe second reason that OSI nevercaught on is that both the model and the pro-tocols are flawed. Thechoice of sevenlayers was more political than technical,and twoofthe layers (session and presentation) are nearly empty,whereas twoother ones (data link and network) are overfull.The OSI model, along with its associated service definitions and protocols, isextraordinarily complex. Whenpiled up, the printed standards occupyasignificantfraction of a meter of paper.Theyare also difficult to implement and inefficient inoperation. Inthis context, a riddle posed by Paul Mockapetris and cited by Rose(1993) comes to mind:Q: What do you get when you cross a mobster with an international standard?A: Someone who makes you an offer you can’tunderstand.In addition to being incomprehensible, another problem with OSI is that somefunctions, such as addressing, flowcontrol, and error control, reappear again andagain in each layer.Saltzer et al. (1984), for example, have pointed out that to beeffective,error control must be done in the highest layer,sothat repeating it overand overineach of the lower layers is often unnecessary and inefficient.Bad ImplementationsGiventhe enormous complexity of the model and the protocols, it will come asno surprise that the initial implementations were huge, unwieldy,and slow. Every-one who tried them got burned. Itdid not takelong for people to associate ‘‘OSI’’'),\n",

Once people think something is bad, its goose is cooked.In contrast, one of the first implementations of TCP/IP was part of BerkeleyUNIX and was quite good (not to mention, free).People beganusing it quickly,which led to a large user community,which led to improvements and which led toan evenlarger community.Here, the spiral was upward instead of downward.Bad PoliticsOn account of the initial implementation, manypeople, especially in academia,thought of TCP/IP as part of UNIX, and UNIX in the 1980s in academia was notunlikeparenthood (then incorrectly called motherhood) and apple pie.OSI, on the other hand, was widely thought to be the creature of the Europeantelecommunication ministries, the European Community,and later the U.S.Gov-ernment. Thisbelief was only partly true, but the very idea of a bunch of govern-ment bureaucrats trying to shove a technically inferior standard down the throats ofthe poor researchers and programmers down in the trenches actually developingcomputer networks did not aid OSI’scause. Somepeople viewed this developmentin the same light as IBM announcing in the 1960s that PL/I was the language of thefuture, or the DoD correcting this later by announcing that it was actually Ada.1.6.4 ACritique of the TCP/IP Reference Model and ProtocolsThe TCP/IP model and protocols also have their problems.First, the modeldoes not clearly distinguish the concepts of services, interfaces, and protocols.Good software engineering practice requires differentiating between the specif-ication and the implementation, something that OSI does very carefully,butTCP/IP does not.Consequently,the TCP/IP model is not much of a guide for de-signing newnetworks using newtechnologies.Second, the TCP/IP model is not at all general and is poorly suited to describ-ing anyprotocol stack other than TCP/IP.Trying to use the TCP/IP model to de-scribe Bluetooth, for example, is completely impossible.Third, the link layer is not really a layer at all in the normal sense of the termas used in the context of layered protocols.It is an interface (between the networkand data link layers).The distinction between an interface and a layer is crucial,and one should not be sloppyabout it.Fourth, the TCP/IP model does not distinguish between the physical and datalink layers.These are completely different. Thephysical layer has to do with thetransmission characteristics of copper wire, fiber optics, and wireless communica-tion. Thedata link layer’sjob is to delimit the start and end of frames and get themfrom one side to the other with the desired degree of reliability.Aproper modelshould include both as separate layers.The TCP/IP model does not do this.Finally,although the IP and TCP protocols were carefully thought out and wellimplemented, manyofthe other early protocols were ad hoc, generally produced'),\n",

For example, the virtual terminal protocol, TELNETwasdesigned for a ten-character-per-second mechanical Teletype terminal.Itknows nothing of graphical user interfaces and mice.Nevertheless, it is still in use50 years later.1.6.5 TheModel Used in This BookAs mentioned earlier,the strength of the OSI reference model is themodelit-self (minus the presentation and session layers), which has proventobeex-ceptionally useful for discussing computer networks. Incontrast, the strength ofthe TCP/IP reference model is theprotocols,which have been widely used formanyyears. Sincecomputer scientists liketohavetheir cakeand eat it, too, wewill use the hybrid model of Fig. 1-36 as the framework for this book.5Application4Transport3Network2Link1PhysicalFigure1-36.The reference model used in this book.This model has fivelayers, running from the physical layer up through the link,network and transport layers to the application layer.The physical layer specifieshowtotransmit bits across different kinds of media as electrical (or other analog)signals. Thelink layer is concerned with howtosend finite-length messages be-tween directly connected computers with specified levels of reliability.Ethernetand 802.11 are examples of link layer protocols.The network layer deals with howtocombine multiple links into networks,and networks of networks, into internetworks so that we can send packets betweendistant computers. This includes the task of finding the path along which to sendthe packets. IPis the main example protocol we will study for this layer.The tran-sport layer strengthens the delivery guarantees of the Network layer,usually withincreased reliability,and provide delivery abstractions, such as a reliable bytestream, that match the needs of different applications.TCP is an important ex-ample of a transport layer protocol.Finally,the application layer contains programs that makeuse of the network.Many, but not all, networked applications have user interfaces, such as a Webbrowser.Our concern, however, iswith the portion of the program that uses thenetwork. Thisis the HTTP protocol in the case of the Web browser.There are also'),\n",

These form the glue that makes the network function.Our chapter sequence is based on this model.In this way,weretain the valueof the OSI model for understanding network architectures, but concentrate primar-ily on protocols that are important in practice, from TCP/IP and related protocolsto newer ones such as 802.11, SONET,and Bluetooth.1.7 STANDARDIZATIONInnovation in Internet technology often depends as much on policyand legalissues as it does on the technology itself. Traditionally,Internet protocols have ad-vanced through a standardization process, which we will nowexplore.1.7.1 Standardizationand Open SourceManynetwork vendors and suppliers exist, each with its own ideas of howthings should be done.Without coordination, there would be complete chaos, andusers would get nothing done.The only way out is to agree on some network stan-dards. Notonly do good standards allowdifferent computers to communicate, buttheyalso increase the market for products adhering to the standards.Alarger mar-ketleads to mass production, economies of scale in manufacturing, better imple-mentations, and other benefits that decrease price and further increase acceptance.In this section, we will takeaquick look at the important but little-known,world of international standardization.But let us first discuss what belongs in astandard. Areasonable person might assume that a standard tells you howaproto-col should work so that you can do a good job of implementing it.That personwould be wrong.Standards define what is needed for interoperability: no more, no less. Thatlets the larger market emerge and also lets companies compete on the basis of howgood their products are. For example, the 802.11 standard defines manytransmis-sion rates but does not say when a sender should use which rate, which is a keyfactor in good performance.That is up to whoevermakes the product. Often get-ting to interoperability this way is difficult, since there are manyimplementationchoices and standards that usually define manyoptions. For 802.11, there were somanyproblems that, in a strategy that has become common practice, a trade groupcalled theWiFi Alliancewasstarted to work on interoperability within the 802.11standard. Inthe context of software-defined networking, theONF(Open Net-working Foundation)aims to develop both standards and open-source softwareimplementations of those standards to ensure the interoperability of protocols tocontrol programmable network switches.Aprotocol standard defines the protocol overthe wire but not the service inter-face inside the box, except to help explain the protocol.Real service interfaces are'),\n",

It only matters that the remote hostspeaks TCP/IP.Infact, TCP and IP are commonly implemented together withoutanydistinct interface. That said, good service interfaces, likegoodAPIs(Applica-tion Programming Interfaces). arevaluable for getting protocols used, and thebest ones (such as Berkeleysockets) can become very popular.Standards fall into twocategories: de facto and de jure.De facto(Latin for‘‘from the fact’’) standards are those that have just happened, without anyformalplan. HTTP,the protocol on which the Web runs, started life as a de facto stan-dard. Itwaspart of early WWW browsers developed by Tim Berners-Lee atCERN, and its use took offwith the growth of the Web.Bluetooth is another ex-ample. It was originally developed by Ericsson but noweveryone is using it.De jure(Latin for ‘‘by law’’) standards, in contrast, are adopted through therules of some formal standardization body.International standardization authori-ties are generally divided into twoclasses: those established by treaty among na-tional governments and those comprising voluntary,non-treaty organizations. Inthe area of computer network standards, there are several organizations of eachtype, notably ITU, ISO, IETF,and IEEE, all of which we will discuss below.In practice, the relationships between standards, companies, and stan-dardization bodies are complicated.De facto standards often evolveinto de jurestandards, especially if theyare successful. This happened in the case of HTTP,which was quickly picked up by IETF.Standards bodies often ratify each others’standards, in what looks likepatting one another on the back, to increase the mar-ketfor a technology.These days, manyadhoc business alliances that are formedaround particular technologies also play a significant role in developing and refin-ing network standards.Forexample,3GPP(Third Generation PartnershipProject)was a collaboration among telecommunications associations that drivesthe UMTS 3G mobile phone standards.1.7.2 Who’sWho in the Telecommunications WorldThe legalstatus of the world’stelephone companies varies considerably fromcountry to country.Atone extreme is the United States, which has many(mostlyvery small) privately owned telephone companies. A fewmore were added withthe breakup of AT&T in 1984 (which was then the world’slargest corporation, pro-viding telephone service to about 80 percent of America’stelephones), and theTelecommunications Act of 1996 that overhauled regulation to foster competition.The idea of fostering competition didn’tturn out as planned though.Large tele-phone companies bought up smaller ones until in most areas there was only one (orat most, two) left.At the other extreme are countries in which the national government has acomplete legalmonopoly on all communication, including the mail, telegraph,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 93}, page_content='70 INTRODUCTION CHAP.1telephone, and often radio and television. Muchof the world falls into this cate-gory.Insome cases, the telecommunication authority is a nationalized company,and in others it is simply a branch of the government, usually known as thePTT(Post, Telegraph & Telephone administration). Worldwide, the trend is towardliberalization and competition and awayfrom government monopoly.Most Euro-pean countries have now (partially) privatized their PTTs, but elsewhere the proc-ess is still only slowly gaining steam.With all these different suppliers of services, there is clearly a need to providecompatibility on a worldwide scale to ensure that people (and computers) in onecountry can call their counterparts in another one.Actually,this need has existedfor a long time.In 1865, representativesfrom manyEuropean governments met toform the predecessor to today’sITU(International Telecommunication Union).Its job was to standardize international telecommunications, which in those daysmeant telegraphy.Even then it was clear that if half the countries used Morse code and the otherhalf used some other code, there was going to be a problem.When the telephonewasput into international service, ITU took overthe job of standardizing telephony(pronounced te-LEF-ony) as well.In 1947, ITU became an agencyofthe UnitedNations.ITU has about 200 governmental members, including almost every member ofthe United Nations.Since the United States does not have a PTT,somebody elsehad to represent it in ITU.This task fell to the State Department, probably on thegrounds that ITU had to do with foreign countries, the State Department’sspe-cialty.ITU also has more than 700 sector and associate members.Theyincludetelephone companies (e.g., AT&T,Vodafone, Sprint), telecom equipment manu-facturers (e.g., Cisco, Nokia, Nortel), computer vendors (e.g., Microsoft, Dell,Toshiba), chip manufacturers (e.g., Intel, Motorola, TI), and other interested com-panies (e.g., Boeing, CBS, VeriSign).ITU has three main sectors.We will focus primarily onITU-T,the Telecom-munications Standardization Sector,which is concerned with telephone and datacommunication systems.Before 1993, this sector was calledCCITT,which is anacronym for its French name, Comite´Consultatif International Te´le´graphique etTe´le´phonique.ITU-R,the Radiocommunications Sector,isconcerned with coor-dinating the use by competing interest groups of radio frequencies worldwide. Theother sector is ITU-D, the Development Sector.Itpromotes the development ofinformation and communication technologies in order to narrowthe ‘‘digitaldivide’’among countries with effective access to the information technologies andcountries with limited access.ITU-T’stask is to maketechnical recommendations about telephone, tele-graph, and data communication interfaces. Theseoften become internationallyrecognized standards, though technically the recommendations are only sugges-tions that governments can adopt or ignore, as theywish (because governments arelike13-year-old boys—theydonot takekindly to being givenorders). Inpractice,'),\n",

This makes it possible for manufacturers toproduce products that work anywhere. Tomakeitpossible to get anything at alldone, the Study Groups are divided into Working Parties, which are in turn dividedinto Expert Teams, which are in turn divided into ad hoc groups.Once a bureau-cracy, always a bureaucracy.Despite all this, ITU-T actually does get things done.Since its inception, ithas produced more than 3000 recommendations, manyofwhich are widely used inpractice. For example, Recommendation H.264 (also an ISO standard known asMPEG-4 AVC) is widely used for video compression, and X.509 public key certifi-cates are used for secure Web browsing and digitally signed email.As the field of telecommunications completes the transition started in the1980s from being entirely national to being entirely global, standards will becomeincreasingly important, and more and more organizations will want to become in-volved in setting them.Formore information about ITU, see Irmer (1994).1.7.3 Who’sWho in the International Standards WorldInternational standards are produced and published byISO(InternationalStandards Organization†), a voluntary non-treaty organization founded in 1946.Its members are the national standards organizations of the 161 member countries.These members include ANSI (U.S.), BSI (Great Britain), AFNOR (France), DIN(Germany), and 157 others.ISO issues standards on a truly vast number of subjects, ranging from nuts andbolts (literally) to telephone pole coatings [not to mention cocoa beans (ISO 2451),fishing nets (ISO 1530), women’sunderwear (ISO 4416), and quite a fewothersubjects one might not think were subject to standardization].On issues oftelecommunication standards, ISO and ITU-T often cooperate (ISO is a member ofITU-T) to avoid the ironyoftwo official and mutually incompatible internationalstandards.Over 21,000 standards have been issued, including the OSI standards.ISO hasover200 Technical Committees (TCs), numbered in the order of their creation,each dealing with some specific subject.TC1 literally deals with the nuts and bolts(standardizing screwthread pitches).JTC1 deals with information technology,in-cluding networks, computers, and software. Itis the first (and so far only) JointTechnical Committee, created in 1987 by merging TC97 with activities in IEC, yet'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 95}, page_content='72 INTRODUCTION CHAP.1another standardization body.Each TC has multiple subcommittees (SCs) that aredivided into working groups (WGs).The real work is done largely in the WGs by over100,000 volunteers world-wide. Manyofthese ‘‘volunteers’’are assigned to work on ISO matters by theiremployers, whose products are being standardized.Others are government offic-ials keen on having their country’sway of doing things become the internationalstandard. Academicexperts also are active inmanyofthe WGs.The procedure used by ISO for adopting standards has been designed toachieve asbroad a consensus as possible.The process begins when one of the na-tional standards organizations feels the need for an international standard in somearea. Aworking group is then formed to come up with aCD(Committee Draft).The CD is then circulated to all the member bodies, which get 6 months to criticizeit. Ifasubstantial majority approves, a revised document, called aDIS(DraftInternational Standard), is produced and circulated for comments and voting.Based on the results of this round, the final text of theIS(International Stan-dard)isprepared, approved, and published.In areas of great controversy,aCDorDIS may have togothrough several versions before acquiring enough votes. Thewhole process can takeyears.NIST(National Institute of Standards and Technology)ispart of the U.S.Department of Commerce.It used to be called the National Bureau of Standards.It issues standards that are mandatory for purchases made by the U.S.Govern-ment, except for those of the Department of Defense, which defines its own stan-dards.Another major player in the standards world isIEEE(Institute of Electricaland Electronics Engineers), the largest professional organization in the world. Inaddition to publishing scores of journals and running hundreds of conferences eachyear,IEEE has a standardization group that develops standards in the area of elec-trical engineering and computing.IEEE’s802 committee has standardized manykinds of LANs.We will study some of its output later in this book.The actualwork is done by a collection of working groups, which are listed in Fig.1-37. Thesuccess rate of the various 802 working groups has been low; having an 802.xnumber is no guarantee of success.Still, the impact of the success stories (espe-cially 802.3 and 802.11) on the industry and the world has been enormous.1.7.4 Who’sWho in the Internet Standards WorldThe worldwide Internet has its own standardization mechanisms, very differentfrom those of ITU-T and ISO.The difference can be crudely summed up by say-ing that the people who come to ITU or ISO standardization meetings wear suits,while the people who come to Internet standardization meetings wear jeans (exceptwhen theymeet in San Diego, when theywear shorts and T-shirts).ITU-T and ISO meetings are populated by corporate officials and governmentcivil servants for whom standardization is their job.Theyregard standardization as'),\n",

Internetpeople, on the other hand, preferanarchyasamatter of principle.However, with hundreds of millions of people alldoing their own thing, little communication can occur.Thus, standards, howeverregrettable, are sometimes needed.In this context, David Clark of M.I.T.oncemade a now-famous remark about Internet standardization consisting of ‘‘roughconsensus and running code.’’When the ARPANET was set up, DoD created an informal committee to over-see it.In 1983, the committee was renamed theIAB(Internet Activities Board)and was givenaslighter broader mission, namely,tokeep the researchers involvedwith the ARPANET and the Internet pointed more or less in the same direction, anactivity not unlikeherding cats.The meaning of the acronym ‘‘IAB’’was laterchanged toInternet ArchitectureBoard.Each of the approximately ten members of the IAB headed a task force onsome issue of importance.The IAB met several times a year to discuss results and'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 97}, page_content='74 INTRODUCTION CHAP.1to give feedback to the DoD and NSF,which were providing most of the funding atthis time.When a standard was needed (e.g., a newrouting algorithm), the IABmembers would thrash it out and then announce the change so the graduate stu-dents (who were the heart of the software effort) could implement it.Communica-tion was done by a series of technical reports calledRFCs(Request For Com-ments). RFCsare stored online and can be fetched by anyone interested in themfromwww.ietf.org/rfc.Theyare numbered in chronological order of creation.Over 8000 nowexist. Wewill refer to manyRFCs in this book.By 1989, the Internet had grown so large that this highly informal style nolonger worked. Manyvendors by then offered TCP/IP products and did not wantto change them just because ten researchers had thought of a better idea.In thesummer of 1989, the IAB was reorganized again. Theresearchers were movedtotheIRTF(Internet Research Task Force), which was made subsidiary to IAB,along with theIETF(Internet Engineering Task Force). TheIAB was populatedwith people representing a broader range of organizations than just the researchcommunity.Itwas initially a self-perpetuating group, with members serving for a2-year term and newmembers being appointed by the old ones.Later,theInter-net Societywascreated, populated by people interested in the Internet.The Inter-net Society is thus in a sense comparable to ACM or IEEE.It is governed byelected trustees who appoint the IAB’smembers.The idea of this split was to have the IRTF concentrate on long-term researchwhile the IETF dealt with short-term engineering issues.That way theywould stayoutof each other’sway.The IETF was divided up into working groups, each with aspecific problem to solve. Thechairs of these working groups initially met as asteering committee to direct the engineering effort. Theworking group topics in-clude newapplications, user information, OSI integration, routing and addressing,security,network management, and standards.Eventually,somanyworkinggroups were formed (more than 70) that theywere grouped into areas and the areachairs met as the steering committee.In addition, a more formal standardization process was adopted, patterned afterISOs. Tobecome aProposed Standard,the basic idea must be explained in anRFC and have sufficient interest in the community to warrant consideration.Toadvance to theDraft Standardstage, a working implementation must have beenrigorously tested by at least twoindependent sites for at least 4 months.If the IABis convinced that the idea is sound and the software works, it can declare the RFCto be anInternet Standard.Some Internet Standards have become DoD stan-dards (MIL-STD), making them mandatory for DoD suppliers.ForWeb standards, theWorld Wide Web Consortium(W3C)develops pro-tocols and guidelines to facilitate the long-term growth of the Web.Itisanindus-try consortium led by Tim Berners-Lee and set up in 1994 as the Web really begunto takeoff.W3C nowhas almost 500 companies, universities, and other organiza-tions as members and has produced well over100 W3C Recommendations, as itsstandards are called, covering topics such as HTML and Web privacy.'),\n",

Aslongas the subjects are restricted to technical topics or hobbies likegardening, not toomanyproblems will arise.The trouble comes with topics that people actually care about, likepolitics,religion, or sex. Views that are publicly posted may be deeply offensive tosomepeople. Furthermore,opinions need not be limited to text; people can easily sharehigh-resolution color photographs and video clips on these platforms. In somecases, such as child pornographyorincitement to terrorism, the speech may also beillegal.The ability of social media and so-calleduser-generated contentplatforms toact as a conduit for illegaloroffensive speech has raised important questions con-cerning the role of these platforms in moderating the content that is hosted on theseplatforms. For a long time, platforms such as Facebook, Twitter,YouTube, andother user-generated content platforms have enjoyed considerable immunity fromprosecution when this content is hosted on their sites. In the United States, for ex-ample, Section 230 of theCommunications Decency Actprotects these platformsfrom federal criminal prosecution should anyillegalcontent be found on their sites.Formanyyears, these social media platforms have claimed that theyare merely aplatform for information, akin to a printing press, and should not be held liable forthe content that theyhost. As these platforms have increasingly curated, priori-tized, and personalized the content that theyshowtoindividual users, however, theargument that these sites are merely ‘‘platforms’’has begun to erode.In both the United States and Europe, for example, the pendulum is beginningto swing, with laws being passed that would hold these platforms accountable forcertain genres of illegalonline content, such as that related to online sextraf-ficking.

If a platform’salgorithm falsely classifies content as offensive orillegaland automatically takes it down, this action may be considered an censor-ship or an affront to free speech. If the laws mandate that the platforms takethesetypes of automated actions, then theymay ultimately be automating censorship.The recording and film industries often advocate for laws that would requirethe use of automated content moderation technologies.In the United States,representativesfrom these industries regularly issueDMCA takedown notices(after theDigital Millennium Copyright Act), which threaten legalaction if theparty in question does not takeaction and remove the content. Importantly,the ISPor content provider is not held liable for copyright infringement if theypass on thetakedown notice to the person who infringed. The ISP or content provider does notactively have toseek out content that violates copyright—that onus falls on thecopyright holder (e.g., the record label or movie producer).Because it is challeng-ing to find and identify copyrighted content, the copyright holders understandablycontinue to push for laws that would shift the onus back to the ISPs and contentproviders.1.8.2 NetNeutralityOne of the more prominent legaland policyquestions overthe past fifteenyears has been the extent to which ISPs can block or prioritize content on their ownnetworks. The notion that ISPs should provide equal quality of service to a giventype of application traffic, regardless of who is sending that content, is oftenreferred to asnetwork neutrality(Wu, 2003).The basic tenets of net neutrality amount to the following four rules: (1) Noblocking, (2) No throttling, (3) No paid prioritization, and (4) Transparencyaboutreasonable network management practices that might be seen as violating anyofthe first three rules. Note that net neutrality does not prevent an ISP from prioritiz-ing anytraffic. As we will see in later chapters, in some cases it may makesensefor an ISP to prioritize real-time traffic(e.g., gaming and video conferencing) overother non-interactive traffic(e.g., a large file backup).The rules typically makeex-ception for such ‘‘reasonable network management practices.’’ What is a ‘‘rea-sonable’’network management practice may be arguable, of course.What therules are intended to prevent are situations where an ISP blocks or throttles trafficas an anti-competitive practice. Specifically,the rules are intended to prevent anISP from blocking or throttling VoIP trafficifitcompetes with its own Internet te-lephonyoffering (as occurred when AT&T blocked Apple’sFaceTime), or when avideo service (e.g., Netflix) competes with its own video-on-demand offering.Although at first the principle of net neutrality may appear straightforward, thelegaland policynuances are significantly more complicated, especially givenhow'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 100}, page_content='SEC. 1.8 POLICY,LEGAL, AND SOCIAL ISSUES 77laws and networks differ between countries. For example, one of the legalques-tions in the United States concerns who has the authority to enforce net neutralityrules. For example, various court rulings overthe past decade have granted andsubsequently revokedthe authority of the Federal Communications Commission(FCC) to enforce net neutrality rules on ISPs. Much of the debate in the UnitedStates centers on whether an ISP should be classified as a ‘‘common carrier’’ser-vice, akin to a public utility,orwhether it should be considered an information ser-vice, with the likes of Google and Facebook. As manyofthese companies offerproducts in an increasingly diverse set of markets, it is becoming harder to classifyacompanyinto one category or another.OnJune 11, 2018, net neutrality wasabolished in the entire United States by order of the FCC.However, some statesmay adopt their own net neutrality rules statewide.Atopic that relates to network neutrality and is prominent in manycountriesaround the world is the practice ofzerorating,whereby an ISP might charge itssubscribers according to data usage but grant an exemption (i.e., ‘‘zero rate’’) for aparticular service. For example, the ISP might charge its subscribers for streamingNetflix, but allowunlimited streaming of other video services that it wants to pro-mote. In some countries, mobile carriers use zero rating as a differentiator: for ex-ample, a mobile carrier might zero rate Twitter as a promotion to try to attract sub-scribers from other carriers. Another example of zero rating is Facebook’s‘‘FreeBasics’’service, which allows ISP subscribers free, unmetered access to a bundleof sites and services that Facebook packages as part of a free offering. Manypar-ties see these offerings as running afoul of net neutrality,since theyoffer preferen-tial access to some services and applications overothers.1.8.3 SecurityThe Internet was designed so that anyone could easily connect to it and beginsending traffic. This open design not only spurred a waveof innovation, but it alsohas made the Internet a platform for attacks of unprecedented scale and scope. Wewill explore security in detail in Chap. 8.One of the most prevalent and pernicious type of attack is aDDoS(Distrib-uted Denial of Service)attack, whereby manymachines on the network send traf-fictowards a victim machine in an attempt to exhaust its resources. There are manydifferent types of DDoS attacks. The simplest form of DDoS attack is one where alarge number of compromised machines, sometimes referred to as abotnet,allsend traffictowards a single victim. DDoS attacks have typically been launchedfrom compromised general-purpose machines (e.g., laptops and servers), but theproliferation of insecure IoT devices has nowcreated a brand-newvector forlaunching DDoS attacks.Can a coordinated attack by a million Internet-connectedsmart toasters takedownGoogle? Unfortunately,much of the IoT industry in par-ticular is unconcerned with software security,and so defending against attackscoming from these highly insecure devices currently falls on network operators.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 101}, page_content='78 INTRODUCTION CHAP.1Newincentive orregulatory structures may be necessary to discourage users fromconnecting insecure IoT devices to the network. In general, manyInternet securityproblems are related to incentives.Spam email(or unwanted electronic mail) nowconstitutes more than 90% ofall email trafficbecause spammers have collected millions of email addresses andwould-be marketers can cheaply send computer-generated messages to them.For-tunately,filtering software is able to read and discard the spam generated by othercomputers. Early spam filtering software relied largely on the contents of emailmessages to differentiate unwanted spam from legitimate emails, but spammersquickly found their way around those filters, since it is relatively easy to generate100 ways of spelling Viagra. On the other hand, properties of the email messagesuch as the IP address of the sender and receiver, aswell as email sending patterns,turn out to be useful distinguishing characteristics that are much more robust toevasion.Some email spam is simply annoying. Other email messages, on the otherhand, may be attempts to launch large-scale scams or steal your personal infor-mation, such as your passwords or bank account information.Phishingmessagesmasquerade as originating from a trustworthyparty,for example, your bank, to tryto trick you into revealing sensitive information, for example, credit card numbers.Identity theft is becoming a serious problem as thievescollect enough informationabout a victim to obtain credit cards and other documents in the victim’sname.1.8.4 PrivacyAs computer networks and the devices that we connect to them proliferate, it isbecoming increasingly easier for various parties to collect data about howeach ofus uses the network. Computernetworks makeitvery easy to communicate, buttheyalso makeiteasy for the people who run the network to snoop on the traffic.Awide range of parties can collect data about your Internet use, including your In-ternet service provider,your mobile phone carrier,applications, Web sites, cloudhosting services, content delivery networks, device manufacturers, advertisers, andWebtracking software vendors.One prominent practice by manyWeb sites and application providers is thepractice ofprofilingandtrackingusers by collecting data about their network be-havior overtime. Onewaythat advertisers track users is by placing small filescalledcookiesthat Web browsers store on users’ computers. Cookies allowadver-tisers and tracking companies to track users’ browsing behavior and activities fromone site to another.More sophisticated tracking mechanisms have also been devel-oped in recent years, such asbrowser fingerprinting;itturns out that the configu-ration of your browser is unique enough to you that a companycan use code on itsWebpage to extract your browser settings and determine your unique identity withhigh probability.Companies that provide Web-based services also maintain largeamounts of personal information about their users that allows them to study user'),\n",

The levelofprotection that each of these systems provides depends onthe properties of the system. For example, a VPN provider may prevent your ISPfrom seeing anyofyour unencrypted Internet traffic, but the operator of the VPNservice can still see the unencrypted traffic. Tor may offer an additional layer ofprotection, but there are varying assessments of its effectiveness, and manyre-searchers have noted its weaknesses, particularly when a single entity controlslarge parts of the infrastructure.Anonymous communication may provide stu-dents, employees, and citizens a way to blowthe whistle on illegalbehavior with-out fear of reprisal.On the other hand, in the United States and most other democ-racies, the lawspecifically permits an accused person the right to confront andchallenge his accuser in court so anonymous accusations cannot be used as evi-dence. Computernetworks raise newlegalproblems when theyinteract with oldlaws. Oneinteresting ongoing legalquestion concerns access to data. For example,what determines whether a government should be able to access data about its citi-zens? If the data resides in another country,isthat data protected from search? Ifdata traverses a country,towhat extent does it become subject to those countries’laws? Microsoftgrappled with these questions in a Supreme Court case, where theU.S. government is attempting to gain access about U.S. citizens on Microsoft ser-vers located in Ireland. It is likely that the ‘‘borderless’’nature of the Internet willcontinue to raise questions at the intersection of lawand technology for years tocome.1.8.5 DisinformationThe Internet makes it possible to find information quickly,but a great deal of itis ill-considered, misleading, or downright wrong.That medical advice youplucked from the Internet about the pain in your chest may have come from aNobel Prize winner or from a high-school dropout.

Finally,what should a network orplatform operator do about it once it is detected?1.9 METRICUNITSTo avoid anyconfusion, it is worth stating explicitly that in this book, as incomputer science in general, metric units are used instead of traditional Englishunits (the furlong-stone-fortnight system).The principal metric prefixes are listedin Fig.1-38. Theprefixes are typically abbreviated by their first letters, with theunits greater than 1 capitalized (KB, MB, etc.).One exception (for historical rea-sons) is kbps for kilobits/sec.Thus, a 1-Mbps communication line transmits 106bits/sec and a 100-psec (or 100-ps) clock ticks every 10< 10seconds.

Thus,a1-KB memory contains 1024 bytes, not 1000 bytes.Notealso the capital ‘‘B’’inthat usage to mean ‘‘bytes’’(units of eight bits), instead of alowercase ‘‘b’’that means ‘‘bits.’’ Similarly,a1-MB memory contains 220(1,048,576) bytes, a 1-GB memory contains 230(1,073,741,824) bytes, and a 1-TBdatabase contains 240(1,099,511,627,776) bytes.However, a 1-kbps communica-tion line transmits 1000 bits per second and a 10-Mbps LAN runs at 10,000,000bits/sec because these speeds are not powers of two.

Otherexamples will be givenwhererelevant.The book is structured according to the hybrid model of Fig.1-36. Startingwith Chapyer 2, we begin working our way up the protocol hierarchybeginning atthe bottom.We provide some background in the field of data communication thatcovers both wired and wireless transmission systems.This material is concernedwith howtodeliverinformation overphysical channels, although we coveronlythe architectural rather than the hardware aspects.Several examples of the physi-cal layer,such as the public switched telephone network, the mobile telephone net-work, and the cable television network are also discussed.Chapters 3 and 4 discuss the data link layer in twoparts. Chapter3looks atthe problem of howtosend packets across a link, including error detection and cor-rection. Welook at DSL (used for broadband Internet access overphone lines) as areal-world example of a data link protocol.In Chapter 4, we examine the medium access sublayer.This is the part of thedata link layer that deals with howtoshare a channel between multiple computers.The examples we look at include wireless, such as 802.11 and wired LANs such asEthernet. Linklayer switches that connect LANs, such as switched Ethernet, arealso discussed here.Chapter 5 deals with the network layer,especially routing. Manyrouting algo-rithms, both static and dynamic, are covered. Even with good routing algorithms,though, if more trafficisoffered than the network can handle, some packets will bedelayed or discarded.We discuss this issue from howtoprevent congestion to howto guarantee a certain quality of service.Connecting heterogeneous networks toform internetworks also leads to numerous problems that are discussed here.Thenetwork layer in the Internet is givenextensive coverage.Chapter 6 deals with the transport layer.Much of the emphasis is on con-nection-oriented protocols and reliability,since manyapplications need these.Both Internet transport protocols, UDP and TCP,are covered in detail, as are theirperformance issues, especially that of TCP,one of the Internet’skey protocols.'),\n",

Wefollowthis with a look at networked multimedia, including stream-ing audio and video.Finally,wediscuss content-delivery networks, includingpeer-to-peer technology.Chapter 8 is about network security.This topic has aspects that relate to alllayers, so it is easiest to treat it after all the layers have been thoroughly explained.The chapter starts with an introduction to cryptography. Later,itshows howcryptographycan be used to secure communication, email, and the Web.Thechapter ends with a discussion of some areas in which security collides with pri-vacy,freedom of speech, censorship, and other social issues.Chapter 9 contains an annotated list of suggested readings arranged by chapter.It is intended to help those readers who would liketopursue their study of net-working further.The chapter also has an alphabetical bibliographyofall the refer-ences cited in this book.The authors’ Web sites:https://www.pearsonhighered.com/tanenbaum (https://www.pearsonhighered.com/tanenbaum )https://computernetworksbook.comhave additional information that may be of interest.1.11 SUMMARYComputer networks have manyuses, both for companies and for individuals, inthe home and while on the move.Companies use networks of computers to sharecorporate information, typically using the client-server model with employee desk-tops acting as clients accessing powerful servers in the machine room.Forindivid-uals, networks offer access to a variety of information and entertainment resources,as well as a way to buy and sell products and services.Individuals often access theInternet via their phone or cable providers at home, though increasingly wirelessaccess is used for laptops and phones.Technology advances are enabling newkinds of mobile applications and networks with computers embedded in appliancesand other consumer devices. Thesame advances raise social issues such as privacyconcerns.Roughly speaking, networks can be divided into LANs, MANs, WANs, and in-ternetworks. LANstypically coverabuilding and operate at high speeds.MANsusually coveracity.Anexample is the cable television system, which is nowusedby manypeople to access the Internet.WANs may coveracountry or a continent.Some of the technologies used to build these networks are point-to-point (e.g., acable) while others are broadcast (e.g., wireless).Networks can be interconnectedwith routers to form internetworks, of which the Internet is the largest and most'),\n",

Wireless networks, for example, 802.11 LANs and 4G mobiletelephony, are also becoming extremely popular.Network software is built around protocols, which are rules by which proc-esses communicate.Most networks support protocol hierarchies, with each layerproviding services to the layer above itand insulating them from the details of theprotocols used in the lower layers.Protocol stacks are typically based either on theOSI model or on the TCP/IP model.Both have link, network, transport, and appli-cation layers, but theydiffer on the other layers.Design issues include reliability,resource allocation, growth, security,and more.Much of this book deals with pro-tocols and their design.Networks provide various services to their users.These services can rangefrom connectionless best-efforts packet delivery to connection-oriented guaranteeddelivery.Insome networks, connectionless service is provided in one layer andconnection-oriented service is provided in the layer above it.Well-known networks include the Internet, the mobile telephone network, and802.11 LANs.The Internet evolved from the ARPANET,towhich other networkswere added to form an internetwork. Thepresent-day Internet is actually a collec-tion of manythousands of networks that use the TCP/IP protocol stack.Themobile telephone network provides wireless and mobile access to the Internet atspeeds of multiple Mbps, and, of course, carries voice calls as well.WirelessLANs based on the IEEE 802.11 standard are deployed in manyhomes, hotels, air-ports, and restaurants, and can provide connectivity at rates of 1 Gbps or more.Wireless networks are also seeing an element of convergence, as evident in propos-als such as LTE-U, which would allowcellular network protocols to operate in theunlicensed spectrum alongside 802.11.Enabling multiple computers to talk to each other requires a large amount ofstandardization, both in the hardware and software. Organizations such as ITU-T,ISO, IEEE, and IAB manage different parts of the standardization process.PROBLEMS1.Imagine that you have trained your St. Bernard, Bernie, to carry a box of three 8-mmtapes instead of a flask of brandy.(When your disk fills up, you consider that an emer-gency.)These tapes each contain 10 gigabytes.

Thephysical layer is the foundation on which the networkis built. Theproperties of different kinds of physical channels determine the per-formance (e.g., throughput, latency, and error rate) so it is a good place to start ourjourneyinto network-land.We will begin by introducing three kinds of transmission media: guided orwired (e.g., copper,coaxial cable, fiber optics), wireless (terrestrial radio), and sat-ellite. Eachof these technologies has different properties that affect the design andperformance of the networks that use them.This material provides backgroundinformation on the key transmission technologies used in modern networks.We then coveratheoretical analysis of data transmission, only to discoverthatMother (Parent?) Nature puts some limits on what can be sent overacommunica-tions channel (i.e., a physical transmission medium used to send bits).Next comesdigital modulation, which is all about howanalog signals are converted into digitalbits and back.After that we will look at multiplexing schemes, exploring howmultiple conversations can be put on the same transmission medium at the sametime without interfering with one another.Finally,wewill look at three examples of communication systems used inpractice for wide area computer networks: the (fixed) telephone system, the mobilephone system, and the cable television system.

The most common guided transmission media are copper cable(in the form of coaxial cable or twisted pair) and fiber optics.Each type of guidedtransmission media has its own set of trade-offs in terms of frequency, bandwidth,delay,cost, and ease of installation and maintenance.Bandwidth is a measure ofthe carrying capacity of a medium. It is measured inHz(or MHz or GHz).It isnamed in honor of the German physicist Heinrich Hertz.We will discuss this indetail later in this chapter.2.1.1 Persistent StorageOne of the most common ways to transport data from one device to another isto write them onto persistent storage, such as magnetic or solid-state storage (e.g.,recordable DVDs), physically transport the tape or disks to the destination ma-chine, and read them back in again. Althoughthis method is not as sophisticatedas using a geosynchronous communication satellite, it is often more cost effective,especially for applications where a high data rate or cost per bit transported is thekeyfactor.Asimple calculation will makethis point clear.Anindustry-standard Ultriumtape can hold 30 terabytes.Abox 60× 60× 60 cm can hold about 1000 of thesetapes, for a total capacity of 800 terabytes, or 6400 terabits (6.4 petabits).Abox oftapes can be delivered anywhere in the United States in 24 hours by FederalExpress and other companies.The effective bandwidth of this transmission is6400 terabits/86,400 sec, or a bit over70Gbps. Ifthe destination is only an hourawaybyroad, the bandwidth is increased to over1700 Gbps.No computer net-work can evenapproach this.Of course, networks are getting faster,but tape den-sities are increasing, too.If we nowlook at cost, we get a similar picture.The cost of an Ultrium tape isaround $40 when bought in bulk. Atape can be reused at least 10 times, so thetape cost is maybe $4000 per box per usage.Add to this another $1000 for ship-ping (probably much less), and we have a cost of roughly $5000 to ship 800 TB.This amounts to shipping a gigabyte for a little overhalf a cent.No network canbeat that.The moral of the story is:Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes hurtlingdown the highway.Formovingverylarge amounts of data, this is often the best solution.Amazonhas what it calls the ‘‘Snowmobile,’’ which is a large truck filled with thousands of'),\n",

Manyapplications, including the Web, video conferencing, andonline gaming, rely on transmitting data with lowdelay.One of the oldest and stillmost common transmission media istwisted pair.Atwisted pair consists of twoinsulated copper wires, typically about 1 mm thick.The wires are twisted togetherin a helical form, similar to a DNAmolecule. Two parallel wires constitute a fineantenna; when the wires are twisted, the wavesfrom different twists cancel out, sothe wire radiates less effectively.Asignal is usually carried as the difference involtage between the twowires in the pair.Transmitting the signal as the differencebetween the twovoltage levels, as opposed to an absolute voltage, provides betterimmunity to external noise because the noise tends to affect the voltage travelingthrough both wires in the same way,leaving the differential relatively unchanged.The most common application of the twisted pair is the telephone system.Nearly all telephones are connected to the telephone company(telco) office by atwisted pair.Both telephone calls and ADSL Internet access run overthese lines.Twisted pairs can run several kilometers without amplification, but for longer dis-tances the signal becomes too attenuated and repeaters are needed.When manytwisted pairs run in parallel for a substantial distance, such as all the wires comingfrom an apartment building to the telephone companyoffice, theyare bundled to-gether and encased in a protective sheath. Thepairs in these bundles would inter-fere with one another if it were not for the twisting.In parts of the world wheretelephone lines run on poles above ground, it is common to see bundles severalcentimeters in diameter.Twisted pairs can be used for transmitting either analog or digital information.The bandwidth depends on the thickness of the wire and the distance traveled, buthundreds of megabits/sec can be achievedfor a fewkilometers, in manycases, andmore when various tricks are used.Due to their adequate performance, widespreadavailability,and lowcost, twisted pairs are widely used and are likely to remain sofor years to come.Twisted-pair cabling comes in several varieties. One common variety of twist-ed-pair cables nowdeployed in manybuildings is calledCategory 5ecabling, or'),\n",

These cables can beused for local area networks.Different LAN standards may use the twisted pairs differently.For example,100-Mbps Ethernet uses two(out of the four) pairs, one pair for each direction.Toreach higher speeds, 1-Gbps Ethernet uses all four pairs in both directions simul-taneously,which requires the receivertofactor out the signal that is transmitted.Some general terminology is nowinorder.Links that can be used in both di-rections at the same time, likeatwo-lane road, are calledfull-duplexlinks. Incontrast, links that can be used in either direction, but only one way at a time, likeasingle-track railroad line, are calledhalf-duplexlinks. Athird category consistsof links that allowtrafficinonly one direction, likeaone-way street. Theyare call-edsimplexlinks.Returning to twisted pair,Cat 5 replaced earlierCategory 3cables with a simi-lar cable that uses the same connector,but has more twists per meter.More twistsresult in less crosstalk and a better-quality signal overlonger distances, making thecables more suitable for high-speed computer communication, especially100-Mbps and 1-Gbps Ethernet LANs.Newwiring is more likely to beCategory 6or evenCategory 7.These cate-gories have more stringent specifications to handle signals with greater band-widths. Somecables in Category 6 and above can support the 10-Gbps links thatare nowcommonly deployed in manynetworks, such as in newoffice buildings.Category 8wiring runs at higher speeds than the lower categories, but operatesonly at short distances of around 30 meters and is thus only suitable in data cen-ters. TheCategory 8 standard has twooptions: Class I, which is compatible withCategory 6A; and Class II, which is compatible with Category 7A.Through Category 6, these wiring types are referred to asUTP(UnshieldedTwisted Pair)astheyconsist simply of wires and insulators.In contrast to these,Category 7 cables have shielding on the individual twisted pairs, as well as aroundthe entire cable (but inside the plastic protective sheath). Shieldingreduces thesusceptibility to external interference and crosstalk with other nearby cables tomeet demanding performance specifications. Thecables are reminiscent of the'),\n",

Ithas better shielding andgreater bandwidth than unshielded twisted pairs, so it can span longer distances athigher speeds.Twokinds of coaxial cable are widely used.One kind, 50-ohmcable, is commonly used when it is intended for digital transmission from the start.The other kind, 75-ohm cable, is commonly used for analog transmission and cabletelevision. Thisdistinction is based on historical, rather than technical, factors(e.g., early dipole antennas had an impedance of 300 ohms, and it was easy to useexisting 4:1 impedance-matching transformers).Starting in the mid-1990s, cableTV operators begantoprovide Internet access overcable, which has made 75-ohmcable more important for data communication.Acoaxial cable consists of a stiffcopper wire as the core, surrounded by aninsulating material.The insulator is encased by a cylindrical conductor,often as aclosely wovenbraided mesh.The outer conductor is covered in a protective plasticsheath. Acutawayviewofacoaxial cable is shown in Fig. 2-2.CoppercoreInsulatingmaterialBraidedouterconductorProtectiveplasticcovering\\nFigure2-2.Acoaxial cable.The construction and shielding of the coaxial cable give itagood combinationof high bandwidth and excellent noise immunity (e.g., from garage door openers,microwave ovens, and more).The bandwidth possible depends on the cable quali-ty and length. Coaxial cable has extremely wide bandwidth; modern cables have abandwidth of up to 6 GHz, thus allowing manyconversations to be simultaneouslytransmitted overasingle coaxial cable (a single television program might occupyapproximately 3.5 MHz).Coaxial cables were once widely used within the tele-phone system for long-distance lines but have now largely been replaced by fiberoptics on long-haul routes.Coax is still widely used for cable television and met-ropolitan area networks and is also used for delivering high-speed Internet con-nectivity to homes in manyparts of the world.'),\n",

There is a yet more common kind ofwiring: electrical power lines. Power lines deliverelectrical power to houses, andelectrical wiring within houses distributes the power to electrical outlets.The use of power lines for data communication is an old idea.Power lineshave been used by electricity companies for low-rate communication such as re-mote metering for manyyears, as well in the home to control devices (e.g., the X10standard). In recent years there has been renewed interest in high-rate communica-tion overthese lines, both inside the home as a LAN and outside the home forbroadband Internet access. Wewill concentrate on the most common scenario:using electrical wires inside the home.The convenience of using power lines for networking should be clear.Simplyplug a TV and a receiverinto the wall, which you must do anyway because theyneed power,and theycan send and receive movies overthe electrical wiring. Thisconfiguration is shown in Fig.2-3. Thereis no other plug or radio. The data signalis superimposed on the low-frequencypower signal (on the active or‘‘hot’’wire)as both signals use the wiring at the same time.\\nPower signal\\nData signalElectric cable\\nFigure2-3.Anetwork that uses household electrical wiring.The difficulty with using household electrical wiring for a network is that itwasdesigned to distribute power signals. This task is quite distinct from distribut-ing data signals, at which household wiring does a horrible job.Electrical signalsare sent at 50–60 Hz and the wiring attenuates the much higher frequency(MHz)signals needed for high-rate data communication. The electrical properties of thewiring vary from one house to the next and change as appliances are turned on andoff, which causes data signals to bounce around the wiring.Transient currentswhen appliances switch on and offcreate electrical noise overawide range of fre-quencies. And without the careful twisting of twisted pairs, electrical wiring acts asafine antenna, picking up external signals and radiating signals of its own. This be-havior means that to meet regulatory requirements, the data signal must avoidlicensed frequencies such as the amateur radio bands.'),\n",

Manyproducts use proprietarystandards for power-line networking, but standards are being developed.2.1.5 FiberOpticsMore than a fewpeople in the computer industry takeenormous pride in howfast computer technology is improving as it follows Moore’slaw,which predicts adoubling of the number of transistors per chip roughly every 2 years (Kuszyk andHammoudeh, 2018).The original (1981) IBM PC ran at a clock speed of 4.77MHz. Forty years later,PCs could run a four-core CPU at 3 GHz. This increase isof a factor of around 2500. Impressive.In the same period, wide area communication links went from 45 Mbps (a T3line in the telephone system) to 100 Gbps (a modern long-distance line).This gainis similarly impressive,more than a factor of 2000, while at the same time the errorrate went from 10< 5per bit to almost zero.In the past decade, single CPUs haveapproached physical limits, which is whythe number of CPU cores per chip isbeing increased.In contrast, the achievable bandwidth with fiber technology is inexcess of 50,000 Gbps (50 Tbps) and we are nowhere near reaching these limits.The current practical limit of around 100 Gbps is simply due to our inability toconvert between electrical and optical signals anyfaster.Tobuild higher-capacitylinks, manychannels are simply carried in parallel overasingle fiber.In this section, we will study fiber optics to learn howthat transmission tech-nology works. Inthe ongoing race between computing and communication, com-munication may yet win because of fiber-optic networks. Theimplication of thiswould be essentially infinite bandwidth and a newconventional wisdom that com-puters are hopelessly slowsothat networks should try to avoid computation at allcosts, no matter howmuch bandwidth that wastes. This change will takeawhile tosink in to a generation of computer scientists and engineers taught to think in termsof the lowtransmission limits imposed by copper wires.Of course, this scenario does not tell the whole story because it does not in-clude cost. The cost to install fiber overthe last mile to reach consumers andbypass the lowbandwidth of wires and limited availability of spectrum is tremen-dous. Italso costs more energy to move bits than to compute. Wemay always haveislands of inequities where either computation or communication is essentiallyfree. For example, at the edge of the Internet we apply computation and storage tothe problem of compressing and caching content, all to makebetter use of Internetaccess links.Within the Internet, we may do the reverse, with companies such asGoogle moving huge amounts of data across the network to where it is cheaper toperform storage or computation.Fiber optics are used for long-haul transmission in network backbones, high-speed LANs (although so far,copper has often managed to catch up eventually),'),\n",

Whenalight ray passes from onemedium to another—for example, from fused silica (glass) to air—the ray isrefracted (bent) at the silica/air boundary,asshown in Fig.2-4(a). Herewe see alight ray incident on the boundary at an angle_ 1emerging at an angle` 1.Theamount of refraction depends on the properties of the twomedia (in particular,their indices of refraction).Forangles of incidence above a certain critical value,the light is refracted back into the silica; none of it escapes into the air.Thus, alight ray incident at or above the critical angle is trapped inside the fiber,asshownin Fig. 2-4(b), and can propagate for manykilometers with virtually no loss.Total internalreflectionAir/silicaboundary\\nLight sourceSilica\\nAir\\n(a) (b)\\n` 1 ` 2 ` 3\\n_ 1 _ 2 _ 3\\nFigure2-4.(a) Three examples of a light ray from inside a silica fiber impingingon the air/silica boundary at different angles.

Currentlyavailable single-mode fibers can transmitdata at 100 Gbps for 100 km without amplification. Even higher data rates havebeen achievedinthe laboratory for shorter distances. The choice between sin-gle-mode or multimode fiber depends on the application.Multimode fiber can beused for transmissions of up to about 15 km and can allowthe use of relatively lessexpensive fiber-optic equipment.On the other hand, the bandwidth of multimodefiber becomes more limited as distance increases.Transmission of Light Through FiberOptical fibers are made of glass, which, in turn, is made from sand, an inex-pensive raw material available in unlimited amounts.Glassmaking was known tothe ancient Egyptians, but their glass had to be no more than 1 mm thick or thelight could not shine through.Glass transparent enough to be useful for windowswasdeveloped during the Renaissance.The glass used for modern optical fibers isso transparent that if the oceans were full of it instead of water,the seabed wouldbe as visible from the surface as the ground is from an airplane on a clear day.The attenuation of light through glass depends on the wavelength of the light(as well as on some of the physical properties of the glass).It is defined as theratio of input to output signal power.For the kind of glass used in fibers, the atten-uation is shown in Fig.2-5 in units of decibels (dB) per linear kilometer of fiber.As an example, a factor of twoloss of signal power corresponds to an attenuationof 10log102= 3dB. Wewill discuss decibels shortly.Inbrief, it is a logarithmicwaytomeasure power ratios, with 3 dB meaning a factor of twopower ratio.Thefigure shows the near-infrared part of the spectrum, which is what is used in prac-tice. Visible light has slightly shorter wavelengths, from about 0.4 to 0.7 microns.(1 micron is 10< 6meters.) Thetrue metric purist would refer to these wavelengthsas 400 nm to 700 nm, but we will stick with traditional usage.Three wavelength bands are most commonly used at present for optical com-munication. Theyare centered at 0.85, 1.30, and 1.55 microns, respectively.Allthree bands are 25,000 to 30,000 GHz wide.The 0.85-micron band was used first.It has higher attenuation and so is used for shorter distances, but at that wavelengththe lasers and electronics could be made from the same material (gallium arsen-ide). Thelast twobands have good attenuation properties (less than 5% loss perkilometer). The 1.55-micron band is nowwidely used with erbium-doped ampli-fiers that work directly in the optical domain.Light pulses sent down a fiber spread out in length as theypropagate. Thisspreading is calledchromatic dispersion.The amount of it is wavelength depen-dent. Onewaytokeep these spread-out pulses from overlapping is to increase thedistance between them, but this can be done only by reducing the signaling rate.Fortunately,ithas been discovered that making the pulses in a special shape relatedto the reciprocal of the hyperbolic cosine causes nearly all the dispersion effects tocancel out, so it is nowpossible to send pulses for thousands of kilometers without'),\n",

Figure2-6(b) shows a sheath with three fibers.Terrestrial fiber sheaths are normally laid in the ground within a meter of thesurface, where theyare occasionally subject to attacks by backhoes or gophers.Near the shore, transoceanic fiber sheaths are buried in trenches by a kind of sea-plow. Indeep water,theyjust lie on the bottom, where theycan be snagged byfishing trawlers or attacked by a giant squid.Fibers can be connected in three different ways. First,theycan terminate inconnectors and be plugged into fiber sockets. Connectorslose about 10 to 20% ofthe light, but theymakeiteasy to reconfigure systems.Second, theycan be splicedmechanically.Mechanical splices just lay the twocarefully cut ends next to eachother in a special sleeve and clamp them in place.Alignment can be improvedbypassing light through the junction and then making small adjustments to maximizethe signal.Mechanical splices taketrained personnel about 5 minutes and result ina10% light loss.Third, twopieces of fiber can be fused (melted) to form a solidconnection. Afusion splice is almost as good as a single drawn fiber,but evenhere, a small amount of attenuation occurs.Forall three kinds of splices, reflec-tions can occur at the point of the splice and the reflected energy can interfere withthe signal.Twokinds of light sources are typically used to do the signaling: LEDs (LightEmitting Diodes) and semiconductor lasers.Theyhavedifferent properties, asshown in Fig.2-7. Theycan be tuned in wavelength by inserting Fabry-Perot orMach-Zehnder interferometers between the source and the fiber.Fabry-Perot inter-ferometers are simple resonant cavities consisting of twoparallel mirrors.Thelight is incident perpendicular to the mirrors.The length of the cavity selects outthose wavelengths that fit inside an integral number of times.Mach-Zehnder inter-ferometers separate the light into twobeams.

Tostart with, it can handle much higher bandwidths than copper.This alone wouldrequire its use in high-end networks. Dueto the lowattenuation, repeaters areneeded only about every 50 km on long lines, versus about every 5 km for copper,resulting in a big cost saving. Fiberalso has the advantage of not being affected bypower surges, electromagnetic interference, or power failures. Noris it affected bycorrosive chemicals in the air,important for harsh factory environments.Oddly enough, telephone companies likefiber for a completely different rea-son: it is thin and lightweight.Manyexisting cable ducts are completely full, sothere is no room to add newcapacity.Removing all the copper and replacing itwith fiber empties the ducts, and the copper has excellent resale value to copperrefiners who regard it as very high-grade ore.Also, fiber is much lighter than cop-per.One thousand twisted pairs 1 km long weigh 8000 kg.Twofibers have morecapacity and weigh only 100 kg, which reduces the need for expensive mechanicalsupport systems that must be maintained.Fornew routes, fiber wins hands downdue to its much lower installation cost.Finally,fibers do not leak light and are dif-ficult to tap.These properties give fiber good security against wiretappers.On the downside, fiber is a less familiar technology requiring skills not all en-gineers have,and fibers can be damaged easily by being bent too much.Since op-tical transmission is inherently unidirectional, two-way communication requires ei-ther twofibers or twofrequencybands on one fiber.Finally,fiber interfaces costmore than electrical interfaces.

Thesewaveswere predicted by the Britishphysicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1865 and first observed by the German physicistHeinrich Hertz in 1887.The number of oscillations per second of a waveis calleditsfrequency,f,and is measured in Hz.The distance between twoconsecutivemaxima (or minima) is called thewavelength,which is universally designated bythe Greek letterh (lambda).When an antenna of the appropriate size is attached to an electrical circuit, theelectromagnetic wavescan be broadcast efficiently and receivedbyareceiversomedistance away. All wireless communication is based on this principle.In a vacuum, all electromagnetic wavestravelatthe same speed, no matterwhat their frequency. This speed, usually called thespeed of light,c,isapproxi-mately 3× 108m/sec, or about 1 foot (30 cm) per nanosecond.(A case could bemade for redefining the foot as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1 nsec rath-er than basing it on the shoe size of some long-dead king.)In copper or fiber,thespeed slows to about 2/3 of this value and becomes slightly frequencydependent.The speed of light is the universe’sultimate speed limit.No object or signal canevermove faster than it.The fundamental relation betweenf,h ,andc(in a vacuum) ish f= c (2-1)Sincecis a constant, if we knowf,wecan findh ,and vice versa. Asarule ofthumb, whenh is in meters andfis in MHz,h f5 300. For example, 100-MHzwavesare about 3 meters long, 1000-MHz wavesare 0.3 meters long, and0.1-meter waveshaveafrequencyof3000 MHz.The electromagnetic spectrum is shown in Fig.2-8. Theradio, microwave,in-frared, and visible light portions of the spectrum can all be used for transmittinginformation by modulating the amplitude, frequency, orphase of the waves. Ultra-violet light, X-rays, and gamma rays would be evenbetter,due to their higher fre-quencies, but theyare hard to produce and modulate, do not propagate wellthrough buildings, and are dangerous to living things.The bands listed at the bottom of Fig.2-8 are the official ITU (InternationalTelecommunication Union) names and are based on the wavelengths, so the LFband goes from 1 km to 10 km (approximately 30 kHz to 300 kHz).The terms LF,'),\n",

Beyond that, there are no names, but Incredibly,Astonish-ingly,and Prodigiously High Frequency(IHF,AHF,and PHF) would sound nice.Above 1012Hz, we get into the infrared, where the comparison is typically to light,not radio.The theoretical basis for communication, which we will discuss later in thischapter,tells us the amount of information that a signal such as an electromagneticwave can carry depends on the receivedpower and is proportional to its bandwidth.From Fig.2-8, it should nowbeobvious whynetworking people likefiber opticsso much.ManyGHz of bandwidth are available to tap for data transmission in themicrowave band, and evenmore bandwidth is available in fiber because it is furtherto the right in our logarithmic scale.As an example, consider the 1.30-micronband of Fig.2-5, which has a width of 0.17 microns. If we use Eq.(2-1) to find thestart and end frequencies from the start and end wavelengths, we find the frequen-cy range to be about 30,000 GHz. With a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio of 10 dB,this is 300 Tbps.Most transmissions use a relatively narrowfrequencyband, in other words,6 f/f<< 1). Theyconcentrate their signal power in this narrowband to use thespectrum efficiently and obtain reasonable data rates by transmitting with enoughpower.The rest of this section describes three different types of transmission thatmakeuse of wider frequencybands.'),\n",

For their invention, she and her friend, the musical composer GeorgeAntheil, receivedU.S. patent 2,292,387.However, theywere unable to convincethe U.S. Navy that their invention had anypractical use and neverreceivedanyroyalties. Onlyyears after the patent expired was the technique rediscovered andused in mobile electronic devices rather than for blocking signals to torpedoes dur-ing war time.2.2.3 Direct Sequence Spread SpectrumAsecond form of spread spectrum,direct sequence spread spectrum,uses acode sequence to spread the data signal overawider frequencyband. Itis widelyused commercially as a spectrally efficient way to let multiple signals share thesame frequencyband. These signals can be givendifferent codes, a method calledcode division multiple access that we will return to later in this chapter.This meth-od is shown in contrast with frequencyhopping in Fig.2-9. Itforms the basis of3G mobile phone networks and is also used in GPS (Global Positioning System).Even without different codes, direct sequence spread spectrum, likefrequencyhop-ping spread spectrum, can tolerate interference and fading because only a fractionof the desired signal is lost.It is used in this role in older versions of the 802.11bwireless LANs protocol.Forafascinating and detailed history of spread spectrumcommunication, see Walters (2013).'),\n",

UWBis also shown inFig. 2-9.With this much bandwidth, UWB has the potential to communicate atseveral hundred megabits per second.Because it is spread across a wide band offrequencies, it can tolerate a substantial amount of relatively strong interferencefrom other narrowband signals.Just as importantly,since UWB has very little en-ergy at anygivenfrequencywhen used for short-range transmission, it does notcause harmful interference to those other narrowband radio signals.In contrast tospread spectrum transmission, UWB transmits in ways that do not interfere withthe carrier signals in the same frequencyband. Itcan also be used for imagingthrough solid objects (ground, walls, and bodies) or as part of precise location sys-tems. The technology is popular for short-distance indoor applications, as well asprecision radar imaging and location-tracking technologies.2.3 USINGTHE SPECTRUM FOR TRANSMISSIONWe will nowdiscuss howthe various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum ofFig. 2-8are used, starting with radio.We will assume that all transmissions use anarrowfrequencyband unless otherwise stated.2.3.1 RadioTransmissionRadio frequency(RF) wavesare easy to generate, can travellong distances,and can penetrate buildings easily,sotheyare widely used for communication,both indoors and outdoors.Radio wavesalso are omnidirectional, meaning that'),\n",

Whenthe driverstepped on the brakepedal, the computerpulsed the brakes on and offinstead of locking them on hard.One fine day anOhio Highway Patrolman beganusing his newmobile radio to call headquarters,and suddenly the Cadillac next to him beganbehaving likeabucking bronco.When the officer pulled the car over, the driverclaimed that he had done nothingand that the car had gone crazy.Eventually,apattern begantoemerge: Cadillacs would sometimes go berserk,butonly on major highways in Ohio and then only when the Highway Patrol wasthere watching. For a long, long time General Motors could not understand whyCadillacs worked fine in all the other states and also on minor roads in Ohio.Onlyafter much searching did theydiscoverthat the Cadillac’swiring made a fine an-tenna for the frequencyused by the Ohio Highway Patrol’snew radio system.The properties of radio wavesare frequencydependent. Atlowfrequencies,radio wavespass through obstacles well, but the power falls offsharply with dis-tance from the source—at least as fast as 1/r2in air—as the signal energy is spreadmore thinly overalarger surface. Thisattenuation is calledpath loss.Athigh fre-quencies, radio wavestend to travelinstraight lines and bounce offobstacles. Pathloss still reduces power,though the receivedsignal can depend strongly on reflec-tions as well.High-frequencyradio wavesare also absorbed by rain and otherobstacles to a larger extent than are low-frequencyones. Atall frequencies, radiowavesare subject to interference from motors and other electrical equipment.It is interesting to compare the attenuation of radio wavestothat of signals inguided media. With fiber,coax, and twisted pair,the signal drops by the same frac-tion per unit distance, for example, 20 dB per 100 m for twisted pair.With radio,the signal drops by the same fraction as the distance doubles, for example 6 dB perdoubling in free space. This behavior means that radio wavescan travellong dis-tances, and interference between users is a problem.Forthis reason, all govern-ments tightly regulate the use of radio transmitters, with fewnotable exceptions,which are discussed later in this chapter.In the VLF,LF, and MF bands, radio wavesfollowthe ground, as illustrated inFig. 2-10(a).These wavescan be detected for perhaps 1000 km at the lower fre-quencies, less at the higher ones.AM radio broadcasting uses the MF band, whichis whythe ground wavesfrom Boston AM radio stations cannot be heard easily inNewYork. Radiowavesinthese bands pass through buildings easily,which iswhyradios work indoors.The main problem with using these bands for data com-munication is their lowbandwidth.In the HF and VHF bands, the ground wavestend to be absorbed by the earth.However, the wavesthat reach the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles circlingthe earth at a height of 100 to 500 km, are refracted by it and sent back to earth, as'),\n",

Undercertain atmospheric conditions, the signals canbounce several times.Amateur radio operators (hams) use these bands to talk longdistance. Themilitary also uses the HF and VHF bands for communication.2.3.2 MicrowaveTransmissionAbove 100 MHz, the wavestravelinnearly straight lines and can therefore benarrowly focused.Concentrating all the energy into a small beam by means of aparabolic antenna (likethe familiar satellite TV dish) givesamuch higher sig-nal-to-noise ratio, but the transmitting and receiving antennas must be accuratelyaligned with each other.Inaddition, this directionality allows multiple transmitterslined up in a rowtocommunicate with multiple receivers in a rowwithout inter-ference, provided some minimum spacing rules are observed. Beforefiber optics,for decades these microwavesformed the heart of the long-distance telephonetransmission system.In fact, MCI, one of AT&T’sfirst competitors after it wasderegulated, built its entire system with microwave communications passing be-tween towers tens of kilometers apart.Even the company’sname reflected this(MCI stood for Microwave Communications, Inc.).MCI has since gone overtofiber and through a long series of corporate mergers and bankruptcies in thetelecommunications shuffle has become part of Verizon.Microwavesaredirectional:theytravelinastraight line, so if the towers aretoo far apart, the earth will get in the way (think about a Seattle-to-Amsterdamlink). Thus,repeaters are needed periodically.The higher the towers are, the far-ther apart theycan be.The distance between repeaters goes up roughly with thesquare root of the tower height.For100-meter towers, repeaters can be 80 kmapart.Unlikeradio wavesatlower frequencies, microwavesdonot pass throughbuildings well.In addition, eventhough the beam may be well focused at thetransmitter,there is still some divergence in space.Some wavesmay be refractedofflow-lying atmospheric layers and may takeslightly longer to arrive than the\"),\n",

Thedelayed wavesmay arrive out of phase with the direct waveandthus cancel the signal.This effect is calledmultipath fadingand is often a seriousproblem. Itis weather and frequencydependent. Someoperators keep 10% oftheir channels idle as spares to switch on when multipath fading temporarily wipesout a particular frequencyband.The demand for higher data rates is driving wireless network operators to yethigher frequencies.Bands up to 10 GHz are nowinroutine use, but at around4GHz, a newproblem sets in: absorption by water.These wavesare only a fewcentimeters long and are absorbed by rain.This effect would be fine if one wereplanning to build a huge outdoor microwave ovenfor roasting passing birds, butfor communication it is a severe problem.As with multipath fading, the only solu-tion is to shut offlinks that are being rained on and route around them.In summary,microwave communication is so widely used for long-distancetelephone communication, mobile phones, television distribution, and other pur-poses that a severe shortage of spectrum has developed. Ithas several key advan-tages overfiber.The main one is that no right of way is needed to lay down cables.By buying a small plot of ground every 50 km and putting a microwave tower on it,one can bypass the telephone system entirely.This is howMCI managed to getstarted as a newlong-distance telephone companysoquickly.(Sprint, anotherearly competitor to the deregulated AT&T,went a completely different route: itwasformed by the Southern Pacific Railroad, which already owned a large amountof right of way and just buried fiber next to the tracks.)Microwave isalso relatively inexpensive.Putting up twosimple towers (whichcan be just big poles with four guy wires) and putting antennas on each one may becheaper than burying 50 km of fiber through a congested urban area or up overamountain, and it may also be cheaper than leasing the telephone company’sfiber,especially if the telephone companyhas not yet evenfully paid for the copper itripped out when it put in the fiber.2.3.3 Infrared TransmissionUnguided infrared wavesare widely used for short-range communication.Theremote controls used for televisions, Blu-ray players, and stereos all use infraredcommunication. Theyare relatively directional, cheap, and easy to build but haveamajor drawback: theydonot pass through solid objects. (Try standing betweenyour remote control and your television and see if it still works.) Ingeneral, as wego from long-waveradio toward visible light, the wavesbehave more and morelikelight and less and less likeradio.On the other hand, the fact that infrared wavesdonot pass through solid wallswell is also a plus.It means that an infrared system in one room of a building willnot interfere with a similar system in adjacent rooms or buildings: you cannot con-trol your neighbor’stelevision with your remote control.Furthermore, security ofinfrared systems against eavesdropping is better than that of radio systems on'),\n",

Usually,lenses are put into thesystem to defocus the beam slightly.Toadd to the difficulty,wind and temperaturechanges can distort the beam and laser beams also cannot penetrate rain or thickfog, although theynormally work well on sunnydays. However, manyofthesefactors are not an issue when the use is to connect twospacecraft.One of the authors (AST) once attended a conference at a modern hotel inEurope in the 1990s at which the conference organizers thoughtfully provided aroom full of terminals to allowthe attendees to read their email during boring pres-entations. Sincethe local phone companywas unwilling to install a large numberof telephone lines for just 3 days, the organizers put a laser on the roof and aimed itat their university’scomputer science building a fewkilometers away. Theytestedit the night before the conference and it worked perfectly.At9A.M.the next day,which was bright and sunny, the link failed completely and stayed down all day.The pattern repeated itself the next 2 days.It was not until after the conferencethat the organizers discovered the problem: heat from the sun during the daytimecaused convection currents to rise up from the roof of the building, as shown inFig. 2-11.This turbulent air diverted the beam and made it dance around thedetector,much likeashimmering road on a hot day.The lesson here is that towork well in difficult conditions as well as good conditions, unguided optical linksneed to be engineered with a sufficient margin of error.Unguided optical communication may seem likeanexotic networking technol-ogy today,but it might soon become much more prevalent. In manyplaces, we aresurrounded by cameras (that sense light) and displays (that emit light using LEDs'),\n",

Informational signs might broadcast maps.Even fes-tive lights might broadcast songs that are synchronized with their display.2.4 FROM WAVEFORMS TOBITSIn this section, we describe howsignals are transmitted overthe physicalmedia we have discussed.

(2-2).Adata signal that has a finite duration, which all of them do, can be handledby just imagining that it repeats the entire pattern overand overforever(i.e., the in-terval fromTto2Tis the same as from 0 toT,etc.).Theanamplitudes can be computed for anygiveng(t)bymultiplying bothsides of Eq.

Thesevalues are of interest because theirsquares are proportional to the energy transmitted at the corresponding frequency.No transmission facility can transmit signals without losing some power in theprocess. Ifall the Fourier components were equally diminished, the resulting sig-nal would be reduced in amplitude but not distorted [i.e., it would have the samenice squared-offshape as Fig.2-12(a)]. Unfortunately,all transmission facilitiesdiminish different Fourier components by different amounts, thus introducing dis-tortion. Usually,for a wire, the amplitudes are transmitted mostly undiminishedfrom 0 up to some frequencyfc(measured inHz) with all frequencies above thiscutofffrequencyattenuated. Thewidth of the frequencyrange transmitted withoutbeing strongly attenuated is called thebandwidth.Inpractice, the cutoffisnotreally sharp, so often the quoted bandwidth is from 0 to the frequencyatwhich thereceivedpower has fallen by half.The bandwidth is a physical property of the transmission medium that dependson, for example, the construction, thickness, length, and material of a wire or fiber.Filters are often used to further limit the bandwidth of a signal.802.11 wirelesschannels generally use roughly 20 MHz, for example, so 802.11 radios filter thesignal bandwidth to this size (although in some cases an 80-MHz band is used).As another example, traditional (analog) television channels occupy6MHzeach, on a wire or overthe air.This filtering lets more signals share a givenregionof spectrum, which improvesthe overall efficiencyofthe system.It means that thefrequencyrange for some signals will not start at zero, but at some higher number.However, this does not matter.The bandwidth is still the width of the band of fre-quencies that are passed, and the information that can be carried depends only onthis width and not on the starting and ending frequencies. Signals that run from 0up to a maximum frequencyare calledbasebandsignals. Signals that are shifted tooccupyahigher range of frequencies, as is the case for all wireless transmissions,are calledpassbandsignals.Nowlet us consider howthe signal of Fig.2-12(a) would look if the bandwidthwere so lowthat only the lowest frequencies were transmitted [i.e., if the functionwere being approximated by the first fewterms of Eq.

Anordinary telephone line, often called avoice-grade line,has an arti-ficially introduced cutofffrequencyjust above 3000 Hz.The presence of thisrestriction means that the number of the highest harmonic passed through is rough-ly 3000/(b/8), or 24,000/b(the cutoffisnot sharp).Forsome data rates, the numbers work out as shown in Fig.2-13. Fromthesenumbers, it is clear that trying to send at 9600 bps overavoice-grade telephoneline will transform Fig.2-12(a) into something looking likeFig. 2-12(c),makingaccurate reception of the original binary bit stream tricky.

Ifwe denote the signal power bySand the noisepower byN,the signal-to-noise ratio isS/N.Usually,the ratio is expressed on alog scale as the quantity 10log10S/Nbecause it can vary overatremendous range.The units of this log scale are calleddecibels(dB), with ‘‘deci’’meaning 10 and‘‘bel’’chosen to honor Alexander Graham Bell, who first patented the telephone.AnS/Nratio of 10 is 10 dB, a ratio of 100 is 20 dB, a ratio of 1000 is 30 dB, andso on.The manufacturers of stereo amplifiers often characterize the bandwidth(frequencyrange) overwhich their products are linear by giving the 3-dB frequen-cy oneach end.These are the points at which the amplification factor has beenapproximately halved (because 10log100. 55 < 3).Shannon’smajor result is that the maximum data rate orcapacityof a noisychannel whose bandwidth isBHz and whose signal-to-noise ratio isS/N,isgivenby: Maximum data rate= Blog2(1+ S/N)bits/sec (2-4)This equation tells us the best capacities that real channels can have.For example,ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line), which provides Internet access overnormal telephone lines, uses a bandwidth of around 1 MHz. The SNR dependsstrongly on the distance of the home from the telephone exchange, and an SNR ofaround 40 dB for short lines of 1 to 2 km is very good. With these characteristics,'),\n",

For ADSL to exceed 12 Mbps, itmust either improve the SNR (for example by inserting digital repeaters in the linescloser to the customers) or use more bandwidth, as is done with the evolution toASDL2+.2.4.3 DigitalModulationNowthat we have studied the properties of wired and wireless channels, weturn our attention to the problem of sending digital information.Wires and wire-less channels carry analog signals such as continuously varying voltage, lightintensity,orsound intensity.Tosend digital information, we must devise analogsignals to represent bits.The process of converting between bits and signals thatrepresent them is calleddigital modulation.We will start with schemes that directly convert bits into a signal.Theseschemes result inbaseband transmission,inwhich the signal occupies frequen-cies from zero up to a maximum that depends on the signaling rate.It is commonfor wires.Then we will consider schemes that regulate the amplitude, phase, orfrequencyofacarrier signal to convey bits. Theseschemes result inpassbandtransmission,inwhich the signal occupies a band of frequencies around the fre-quencyofthe carrier signal.It is common for wireless and optical channels forwhich the signals must reside in a givenfrequencyband.Channels are often shared by multiple signals. After all, it is much more con-venient to use a single wire to carry several signals than to install a wire for everysignal. Thiskind of sharing is calledmultiplexing.Itcan be accomplished in sev-eral different ways. Wewill present methods for time, frequency, and code divisionmultiplexing.The modulation and multiplexing techniques we describe in this section are allwidely used for wires, fiber,terrestrial wireless, and satellite channels.Baseband TransmissionThe most straightforward form of digital modulation is to use a positive volt-age to represent a 1 bit and a negative voltage to represent a 0 bit, as can be seen in'),\n",

Todecode the bits, the receivermaps the signal samples to the closest symbols.ForNRZ, a positive voltage willbe taken to indicate that a 1 was sent and a negative voltage will be taken to indi-cate that a 0 was sent.NRZ is a good starting point for our studies because it is simple, but it is sel-dom used by itself in practice. More complexschemes can convert bits to signalsthat better meet engineering considerations.These schemes are calledline codes.Below, wedescribe line codes that help with bandwidth efficiency, clock recovery,and DC balance.Bandwidth EfficiencyWith NRZ, the signal may cycle between the positive and negative levels up toevery 2 bits (in the case of alternating 1s and 0s).This means that we need a band-width of at leastB/2 Hzwhen the bit rate isBbits/sec. Thisrelation comes fromthe Nyquist rate [Eq. (2-3)].It is a fundamental limit, so we cannot run NRZ fasterwithout using additional bandwidth.Bandwidth is often a limited resource, even'),\n",

By using four voltages, for instance, we can send 2 bits atonce as a singlesymbol.This design will work as long as the signal at the receiveris sufficiently strong to distinguish the four levels. Therate at which the signalchanges is then half the bit rate, so the needed bandwidth has been reduced.We call the rate at which the signal changes thesymbol rateto distinguish itfrom thebit rate.The bit rate is the symbol rate multiplied by the number of bitsper symbol.An older name for the symbol rate, particularly in the context of de-vices called telephone modems that convey digital data overtelephone lines, is thebaud rate.Inthe literature, the terms ‘‘bit rate’’and ‘‘baud rate’’are often usedincorrectly.Note that the number of signal levels does not need to be a power of two. Oftenit is not, with some of the levels used for protecting against errors and simplifyingthe design of the receiver.Clock RecoveryForall schemes that encode bits into symbols, the receivermust knowwhenone symbol ends and the next symbol begins to correctly decode the bits.WithNRZ, in which the symbols are simply voltage levels, a long run of 0s or 1s leavesthe signal unchanged.After a while, it is hard to tell the bits apart, as 15 zeroslook much like16zeros unless you have a very accurate clock.Accurate clocks would help with this problem, but theyare an expensive solu-tion for commodity equipment.Remember,weare timing bits on links that run atmanymegabits/sec, so the clock would have todrift less than a fraction of amicrosecond overthe longest permitted run.This might be reasonable for slowlinks or short messages, but it is not a general solution.One strategy is to send a separate clock signal to the receiver. Another clockline is no big deal for computer buses or short cables in which there are manylinesin parallel, but it is wasteful for most network links since if we had another line tosend a signal we could use it to send data.Aclevertrick here is to mix the clocksignal with the data signal by XORing them together so that no extra line is need-ed. Theresults are shown in Fig.2-14(d). Theclock makes a clock transition inevery bit time, so it runs at twice the bit rate.When it is XORed with the 0 level, itmakes a low-to-high transition that is simply the clock.This transition is a logical0. Whenit is XORed with the 1 levelitisinverted and makes a high-to-lowtran-sition. This transition is a logical 1.This scheme is calledManchester encodingand was used for classic Ethernet.The downside of Manchester encoding is that it requires twice as much band-width as NRZ due to the clock, and we have learned that bandwidth often matters.Adifferent strategy is based on the idea that we should code the data to ensure that'),\n",

Thiscoding is calledNRZI(Non-Return-to-ZeroInverted), a twist on NRZ.An example is shown in Fig.2-14(c).The popularUSB(Universal Serial Bus)standard for connecting computer per-ipherals uses NRZI.With it, long runs of 1s do not cause a problem.Of course, long runs of 0s still cause a problem that we must fix. Ifwe werethe telephone company, wemight simply require that the sender not transmit toomany0s. Olderdigital telephone lines in the United States, called T1 lines (dis-cussed later) did, in fact, require that no more than 15 consecutive 0sbesent forthem to work correctly.Toreally fix the problem, we can break up runs of 0s bymapping small groups of bits to be transmitted so that groups with successive 0sare mapped to slightly longer patterns that do not have too manyconsecutive 0s.Awell-known code to do this is called4B/5B.Every 4 bits is mapped into a5-bit pattern with a fixed translation table. The fivebit patterns are chosen so thatthere will neverbearun of more than three consecutive 0s. Themapping is shownin Fig.2-15. Thisscheme adds 25% overhead, which is better than the 100% over-head of Manchester encoding. Since there are 16 input combinations and 32 outputcombinations, some of the output combinations are not used.Putting aside thecombinations with too manysuccessive 0s, there are still some codes left.

Thereceiverthen XORs the incoming bits with the same pseudoran-dom sequence to recoverthe real data. For this to be practical, the pseudorandomsequence must be easy to create. It is commonly givenasthe seed to a simple ran-dom number generator.Scrambling is attractive because it adds no bandwidth or time overhead. Infact, it often helps to condition the signal so that it does not have its energy in dom-inant frequencycomponents (caused by repetitive data patterns) that might radiateelectromagnetic interference.Scrambling helps because random signals tend to be‘‘white,’’ orhaveenergy spread across the frequencycomponents.However, scrambling does not guarantee that there will be no long runs.It ispossible to get unluckyoccasionally.Ifthe data are the same as the pseudorandomsequence, theywill XOR to all 0s.This outcome does not generally occur with along pseudorandom sequence that is difficult to predict. However, with a short orpredictable sequence, it might be possible for malicious users to send bit patternsthat cause long runs of 0s after scrambling and cause links to fail. Earlyversionsof the standards for sending IP packets overSONET links in the telephone systemhad this defect (Malis and Simpson, 1999).It was possible for users to send cer-tain ‘‘killer packets’’that were guaranteed to cause problems.Balanced SignalsSignals that have asmuch positive voltage as negative voltage evenovershortperiods of time are calledbalanced signals.Theyaverage to zero, which meansthat theyhaveno DC electrical component.The lack of a DC component is an ad-vantage because some channels, such as coaxial cable or lines with transformers,strongly attenuate a DC component due to their physical properties.Also, onemethod of connecting the receivertothe channel calledcapacitive couplingpassesonly the ACportion of a signal.In either case, if we send a signal whose averageis not zero, we waste energy as the DC component will be filtered out.Balancing helps to provide transitions for clock recovery since there is a mixof positive and negative voltages. Italso provides a simple way to calibrate re-ceivers because the average of the signal can be measured and used as a decisionthreshold to decode symbols. With unbalanced signals, the average may drift awayfrom the true decision leveldue to a density of 1s, for example, which would causemore symbols to be decoded with errors.Astraightforward way to construct a balanced code is to use twovoltage levelsto represent a logical 1 and a logical zero.Forexample, +1Vfor a 1 bit and< 1Vfor a 0 bit.To send a 1, the transmitter alternates between the +1 V and< 1Vlev-els so that theyalways average out.This scheme is calledbipolar encoding.Intelephone networks, it is calledAMI(Alternate Mark Inversion), building on oldterminology in which a 1 is called a ‘‘mark’’and a 0 is called a ‘‘space.’’ Anex-ample is giveninFig. 2-14(e).'),\n",

Alternatively,wecan use a mapping like4B/5B to achieve balance (as well as transitions for clockrecovery). Anexample of this kind of balanced code is the8B/10Bline code.Itmaps 8 bits of input to 10 bits of output, so it is 80% efficient, just likethe 4B/5Bline code.The 8 bits are split into a group of 5 bits, which is mapped to 6 bits, andagroup of 3 bits, which is mapped to 4 bits. The 6-bit and 4-bit symbols are thenconcatenated. Ineach group, some input patterns can be mapped to balanced out-put patterns that have the same number of 0s and 1s. For example, ‘‘001’’ismap-ped to ‘‘1001,’’ which is balanced.But there are not enough combinations for alloutput patterns to be balanced.Forthese cases, each input pattern is mapped totwooutput patterns.One will have anextra 1 and the alternate will have anextra0. For example, ‘‘000’’ismapped to both ‘‘1011’’and its complement ‘‘0100.’’ Asinput bits are mapped to output bits, the encoder remembers thedisparityfrom theprevious symbol. The disparity is the total number of 0s or 1s by which the signalis out of balance.The encoder then selects either an output pattern or its alternateto reduce the disparity.With 8B/10B, the disparity will be at most 2 bits.Thus,the signal will neverbefar from balanced.There will also neverbemore than fiveconsecutive 1sor0s, to help with clock recovery.Passband TransmissionCommunication overbaseband frequencies is most appropriate for wired trans-missions, such as twisted pair,coax, or fiber.Inother circumstances, particularlythose involving wireless networks and radio transmissions, we need to use a rangeof frequencies that does not start at zero to send information across a channel.Specifically,for wireless channels, it is not practical to send very lowfrequencysignals because the size of the antenna needs to be a fraction of the signalwavelength, which becomes large at high transmission frequencies.In anycase,regulatory constraints and the need to avoid interference usually dictate the choiceof frequencies.Even for wires, placing a signal in a givenfrequencyband is usefulto let different kinds of signals coexist on the channel.This kind of transmission iscalled passband transmission because an arbitrary band of frequencies is used topass the signal.Fortunately,our fundamental results from earlier in the chapter are all in termsof bandwidth, or thewidthof the frequencyband. Theabsolute frequencyvaluesdo not matter for capacity.This means that we can takeabasebandsignal thatoccupies 0 toBHz and shift it up to occupyapassband ofStoS+ BHz withoutchanging the amount of information that it can carry,eventhough the signal willlook different. Toprocess a signal at the receiver, wecan shift it back down tobaseband, where it is more convenient to detect symbols.Digital modulation is accomplished with passband transmission by modulatingacarrier signal that sits in the passband.We can modulate the amplitude, frequen-cy,orphase of the carrier signal.

When making the assignment, an important consideration is that a smallburst of noise at the receivernot lead to manybit errors.This might happen if weassigned consecutive bit values to adjacent symbols.With QAM-16, for example,if one symbol stood for 0111 and the neighboring symbol stood for 1000, if the re-ceivermistakenly picks the adjacent symbol, it will cause all of the bits to bewrong.

The three main ways to multiplexasingle physical line are time, frequency, and code; there is also a technique calledwavelength division multiplexing, which is essentially an optical form of frequencydivision multiplexing. Wediscuss each of these techniques below.Frequency Division MultiplexingFDM(Frequency Division Multiplexing)takes advantage of passband trans-mission to share a channel.It divides the spectrum into frequencybands, witheach user having exclusive possession of some band in which to send a signal.AMradio broadcasting illustrates FDM.The allocated spectrum is about 1 MHz,roughly 500 to 1500 kHz.Different frequencies are allocated to different logicalchannels (stations), each operating in a portion of the spectrum, with the interchan-nel separation great enough to prevent interference.Foramore detailed example, in Fig.2-19 we see three voice-grade telephonechannels multiplexedusing FDM.Filters limit the usable bandwidth to roughly3100 Hz per voice-grade channel.When manychannels are multiplexedtogether,4000 Hz is allocated per channel.The excess bandwidth is called aguard band.'),\n",

However, FDM continuesto be used in telephone networks, as well as cellular,terrestrial wireless, and satel-lite networks at a higher levelofgranularity.When sending digital data, it is possible to divide the spectrum efficientlywithout using guard bands. InOFDM(Orthogonal Frequency Division Multi-plexing), the channel bandwidth is divided into manysubcarriers that indepen-dently send data (e.g., with QAM). The subcarriers are packed tightly together inthe frequencydomain. Thus, signals from each subcarrier extend into adjacentones. However, asseen in Fig.2-20, the frequencyresponse of each subcarrier isdesigned so that it is zero at the center of the adjacent subcarriers. The subcarrierscan therefore be sampled at their center frequencies without interference from theirneighbors. Tomakethis work, aguard timeis needed to repeat a portion of thesymbol signals in time so that theyhavethe desired frequencyresponse. However,this overhead is much less than is needed for manyguard bands.'),\n",

This division is valuablebecause degradations of the channel are easier to cope with at the subcarrier level;some subcarriers may be very degraded and excluded in favorofsubcarriers thatare receivedwell.Time Division MultiplexingAn alternative toFDM isTDM(Time Division Multiplexing). Here,theusers taketurns (in a round-robin fashion), each one periodically getting the entirebandwidth for a certain time interval. Anexample of three streams being multi-plexedwith TDM is shown in Fig.2-21. Bitsfrom each input stream are taken in afixedtime slotand output to the aggregate stream. This stream runs at the sum rateof the individual streams.Forthis to work, the streams must be synchronized intime. Smallintervals of guard time (analogous to a frequencyguard band) may beadded to accommodate small timing variations.TDM is used widely as key technique in the telephone and cellular networks.To avoid one point of confusion, let us be clear that it is quite different from the al-ternativeSTDM(Statistical Time Division Multiplexing). Theprefix ‘‘statisti-cal’’isadded to indicate that the individual streams contribute to the multiplexedstreamnoton a fixed schedule, but according to the statistics of their demand.STDM is fundamentally likepacket switching under another name.'),\n",

This can makeitmore tolerant of interference, as well as allowingmultiple signals from different users to share the same frequencyband. Becausecode division multiplexing is mostly used for the latter purpose it is commonlycalledCDMA(Code Division Multiple Access).CDMA allows each station to transmit overthe entire frequencyspectrum allthe time.Multiple simultaneous transmissions are separated using coding theory.Before getting into the algorithm, let us consider an analogy: an airport loungewith manypairs of people conversing.

CDMAis somewhat comparable to each pair of people talking at once, but inadifferent language.The French-speaking couple just hones in on the French,rejecting everything that is not French as noise.Thus, the key toCDMA is to beable to extract the desired signal while rejecting everything else as random noise.Asomewhat simplified description of CDMA follows.In CDMA, each bit time is subdivided intomshort intervals calledchips,which are multiplied against the original data sequence (the chips are a bit se-quence, but are called chips so that the are not confused with the bits of the actualmessage). Typically,there are 64 or 128 chips per bit, but in the example givenhere we will use 8 chips/bit for simplicity.Each station is assigned a uniquem-bitcode called achip sequence.For pedagogical purposes, it is convenient to writethese codes as sequences of< 1and +1.We will showchip sequences in par-entheses.To transmit a 1 bit, a station sends its chip sequence.To transmit a 0 bit, itsends the negation of its chip sequence.No other patterns are permitted.Thus, form= 8, if stationAis assigned the chip sequence (< 1< 1< 1+ 1+ 1< 1+ 1+ 1), itcan send a 1 bit by transmitting the chip sequence and a 0 by transmitting its com-plement: (+ 1+ 1+ 1< 1< 1+ 1< 1< 1).

Weassume for nowthat all stations are synchronized in time,so all chip sequences begin at the same instant.When twoormore stations trans-mit simultaneously,their bipolar sequences add linearly.For example, if in onechip period three stations output +1 and one station outputs< 1, +2 will be re-ceived. Onecan think of this as signals that add as voltages superimposed on thechannel: three stations output +1 V and one station outputs< 1V,sothat 2 V is re-ceived. For instance, in Fig.2-22(c) we see six examples of one or more stationstransmitting 1 bit at the same time.In the first example,Ctransmits a 1 bit, so wejust getC’s chip sequence.In the second example, bothBandCtransmit 1 bits, sowe get the sum of their bipolar chip sequences, namely:(< 1< 1+ 1< 1+ 1+ 1+ 1< 1)+ (< 1+ 1< 1+ 1+ 1+ 1< 1< 1)= (< 2000+ 2+ 20< 2)To recoverthe bit stream of an individual station, the receivermust knowthatstation’schip sequence in advance.

Aslong as each channel has its own dedicated frequency(that is, its ownwavelength) range and all the ranges are disjoint, theycan be multiplexedtogetheron the long-haul fiber.The only difference with electrical FDM is that an opticalsystem using a diffraction grating is completely passive and thus highly reliable.The reason WDM is popular is that the energy on a single channel is typicallyonly a fewgigahertz wide because that is the current limit of howfast we can con-vert between electrical and optical signals.By running manychannels in parallelon different wavelengths, the aggregate bandwidth is increased linearly with thenumber of channels.Since the bandwidth of a single fiber band is ca. 25,000 GHz(see Fig.2-5), there is theoretically room for 2500 10-Gbps channels evenat1bit/Hz (and higher rates are also possible).WDM technology has been progressing at a rate that puts computer technologyto shame.WDM was invented around 1990.The first commercially available sys-tems had eight channels of 2.5 Gbps per channel; by 1998, systems with 40 chan-nels of 2.5 Gbps were on the market and rapidly being adopted; by 2006, therewere products with 192 channels of 10 Gbps and 64 channels of 40 Gbps, capableof moving up to 2.56 Tbps; by 2019, there were systems that can handle up to 160channels, supporting more than 16 Tbps overasingle fiber pair.That is 800 timesmore capacity than the 1990 systems.The channels are also packed tightly on thefiber,with 200, 100, or as little as 50 GHz of separation.Narrowing the spacing to 12.5 GHz makes it possible to support 320 channelson a single fiber,further increasing transmission capacity.Such systems with alarge number of channels and little space between each channel are referred to asDWDM(Dense WDM). DWDM systems tend to be more expensive because theymust maintain stable wavelengths and frequencies, due to the close spacing of eachchannel. As a result, these systems closely regulate their temperature to ensure thatfrequencies are accurate.One of the drivers of WDM technology is the development of all-optical com-ponents. Previously,every 100 km it was necessary to split up all the channels andconvert each one to an electrical signal for amplification separately before recon-verting them to optical signals and combining them.Nowadays, all-optical ampli-fiers can regenerate the entire signal once every 1000 km without the need for mul-tiple opto-electrical conversions.In the example of Fig.2-23, we have a fixed-wavelength system.Bits frominput fiber 1 go to output fiber 3, bits from input fiber 2 go to output fiber 1, etc.However, itisalso possible to build WDM systems that are switched in the opticaldomain. Insuch a device, the output filters are tunable using Fabry-Perot or Mach-Zehnder interferometers.These devices allowthe selected frequencies to bechanged dynamically by a control computer.This ability provides a large amountof flexibility to provision manydifferent wavelength paths through the telephonenetwork from a fixed set of fibers.

Consequently,the network designers mustrely on the existing telecommunication facilities, such as the telephone network,the cellular network, or the cable television network.The limiting factor for data networking has long been the ‘‘last mile’’overwhich customers connect, which might rely on anyone of these physical technolo-gies, as opposed to the so-called ‘‘backbone’’infrastructure for the rest of the ac-cess network. Over the past decade, this situation has changed dramatically,withspeeds of 1 Gbps to the home becoming increasingly commonplace.Although onecontributor to faster last-mile speeds is the continued rollout of fiber at the edge ofthe network, perhaps an evenmore significant contributor in some countries is thesophisticated engineering of theexistingtelephone and cable networks to squeezeincreasingly more bandwidth out of the existing infrastructure.It turns out that en-gineering the existing physical infrastructure to increase transmission speeds is alot less expensive than putting new(fiber) cables in the ground to everyone’shomes. Wenow explore the architectures and characteristics of each of these phys-ical communications infrastructures.These existing facilities, especially thePSTN(Public Switched TelephoneNetwork), were usually designed manyyears ago, with a completely different goalin mind: transmitting the human voice in a more-or-less recognizable form.Acable running between twocomputers can transfer data at 10 Gbps or more; thephone network thus has its work cut out for it in terms of transmitting bits at highrates. Early Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technologies could only transmit data atrates of a fewMbps; now, more modern versions of DSL, can achieve rates ap-proaching 1 Gbps.In the following sections, we will describe the telephone sys-tem and showhow itworks. For additional information about the innards of thetelephone system, see Laino (2017).2.5.1 Structureofthe Telephone SystemSoon after Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone in 1876 (just a fewhours ahead of his rival, Elisha Gray), there was an enormous demand for his newinvention. Theinitial market was for the sale of telephones, which came in pairs.It was up to the customer to string a single wire between them.If a telephoneowner wanted to talk tonother telephone owners, separate wires had to be strungto allnhouses.

(b)Centralized switch.(c) Two-levelhierarchy.To his credit, Bell sawthis problem early on and formed the Bell TelephoneCompany, which opened its first switching office (in NewHaven, Connecticut) in1878. Thecompanyran a wire to each customer’shouse or office. Tomakeacall,the customer would crank the phone to makearinging sound in the telephone com-panyoffice to attract the attention of an operator,who would then manually con-nect the caller to the callee by using a short jumper cable.The model of a singleswitching office is illustrated in Fig. 2-24(b).Pretty soon, Bell System switching offices were springing up everywhere andpeople wanted to makelong-distance calls between cities, so the Bell Systembegantoconnect the switching offices. Theoriginal problem soon returned: toconnect every switching office to every other switching office by means of a wirebetween them quickly became unmanageable, so second-levelswitching officeswere invented. Afterawhile, multiple second-leveloffices were needed, as illus-trated in Fig. 2-24(c).Eventually,the hierarchygrewtofivelevels.By 1890, the three major parts of the telephone system were in place: theswitching offices, the wires between the customers and the switching offices (bynowbalanced, insulated, twisted pairs instead of open wires with an earth return),and the long-distance connections between the switching offices. For a short tech-nical history of the telephone system, see Hawley(1991).While there have been improvements in all three areas since then, the basicBell System model has remained essentially intact for over100 years.The follow-ing description is highly simplified but givesthe essential flavornevertheless.Each telephone has twocopper wires coming out of it that go directly to the tele-phone company’snearestend office(also called alocal central office). Thedis-tance is typically around 1 to 10 km, being shorter in cities than in rural areas.In'),\n",

Thetwo-wire con-nections between each subscriber’stelephone and the end office are known in thetrade as thelocal loop.Ifthe world’slocal loops were stretched out end to end,theywould extend to the moon and back 1000 times.At one time, 80% of AT&T’scapital value was the copper in the local loops.AT&T was then, in effect, the world’slargest copper mine.Fortunately,this factwasnot well known in the investment community.Had it been known, some cor-porate raider might have bought AT&T,ended all telephone service in the UnitedStates, ripped out all the wire, and sold it to a copper refiner for a quick payback.If a subscriber attached to a givenend office calls another subscriber attachedto the same end office, the switching mechanism within the office sets up a directelectrical connection between the twolocal loops.This connection remains intactfor the duration of the call.If the called telephone is attached to another end office, a different procedurehas to be used.Each end office has a number of outgoing lines to one or morenearby switching centers, calledtoll offices(or,iftheyare within the same localarea,tandem offices). Theselines are calledtoll connecting trunks.The numberof different kinds of switching centers and their topology varies from country tocountry depending on the country’stelephone density.If both the caller’sand callee’send offices happen to have a toll connectingtrunk to the same toll office (a likely occurrence if theyare relatively close by), theconnection may be established within the toll office. Atelephone network consist-ing only of telephones (the small dots), end offices (the large dots), and toll offices(the squares) is shown in Fig. 2-24(c).If the caller and callee do not have a toll office in common, a path will have tobe established between twotoll offices. Thetoll offices communicate with eachother via high-bandwidthintertoll trunks(also calledinteroffice trunks). Priorto the 1984 breakup of AT&T,the U.S. telephone system used hierarchical routingto find a path, going to higher levels of the hierarchyuntil there was a switchingoffice in common. This was then replaced with more flexible, non-hierarchicalrouting.

Coaxialcables, microwaves, and especially fiberoptics are widely used between switching offices.In the past, transmission throughout the telephone system was analog, with theactual voice signal being transmitted as an electrical voltage from source to desti-nation. With the advent of fiber optics, digital electronics, and computers, all thetrunks and switches are nowdigital, leaving the local loop as the last piece of ana-log technology in the system.Digital transmission is preferred because it is notnecessary to accurately reproduce an analog waveform after it has passed throughmanyamplifiers on a long call.Being able to correctly distinguish a 0 from a 1 isenough. Thisproperty makes digital transmission more reliable than analog.It isalso cheaper and easier to maintain.In summary,the telephone system consists of three major components:1. Localloops (analog twisted pairs between end offices and localhouses and businesses).2. Trunks (very high-bandwidth digital fiber-optic links connecting theswitching offices).3. Switchingoffices (where calls are movedfrom one trunk to anothereither electrically or optically).The local loops provide everyone access to the whole system, so theyare critical.Unfortunately,theyare also the weakest link in the system.The main challengefor long-haul trunks involves collecting multiple calls and sending them out overthe same fiber,which is done using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM).Finally,there are twofundamentally different ways of doing switching: circuitswitching and packet switching.We will look at both.2.5.2 TheLocal Loop: Telephone Modems, ADSL, and FiberIn this section, we will study the local loop, both old and new. Wewill covertelephone modems, ADSL, and fiber to the home.In some places, the local loophas been modernized by installing optical fiber to (or at least very close to) thehome. These installations support computer networks from the ground up, with thelocal loop having ample bandwidth for data services. Unfortunately,the cost oflaying fiber to homes is substantial. Sometimes, it is done when local city streetsare dug up for other purposes; some municipalities, especially in densely populatedurban areas, have fiber local loops. By and large, however, fiber local loops are theexception, but theyare clearly the future.'),\n",

Telephone modems send digital data between computers overthe nar-rowchannel the telephone network provides for a voice call.Theywere oncewidely used, but have been largely displaced by broadband technologies such asADSL that reuse the local loop to send digital data from a customer to the endoffice, where theyare siphoned offtothe Internet.Both modems and ADSL mustdeal with the limitations of old local loops: relatively narrowbandwidth, attenua-tion and distortion of signals, and susceptibility to electrical noise such ascrosstalk.To send bits overthe local loop, or anyother physical channel for that matter,theymust be converted to analog signals that can be transmitted overthe channel.This conversion is accomplished using the methods for digital modulation that westudied in the previous section.At the other end of the channel, the analog signalis converted back to bits.Adevice that converts between a stream of digital bits and an analog signalthat represents the bits is called amodem,which is short for ‘‘modulatordemodu-lator.’’Modems come in manyvarieties, including telephone modems, DSLmodems, cable modems, and wireless modems. In the case of a cable or DSLmodem, the device is typically a separate piece of hardware that sits in between thephysical line coming into the house and the rest of the network inside the home.Wireless devices typically have their own built-in modems.Logically,the modemis inserted between the (digital) computer and the (analog) telephone system, asseen in Fig. 2-26.\\nEndofficeCodecModem\\nComputerLocal loop(analog)Trunk (digital, fiber)Digital line\\nAnalog lineCodecModemISP 1\\nISP 2\\nFigure2-26.The use of both analog and digital transmission for a com-puter-to-computer call.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 159}, page_content='136 THE PHYSICAL LAYER CHAP.2main difficulty in doing so is that a voice-grade telephone line is limited to only3100 Hz, about what is sufficient to carry a conversation. This bandwidth is morethan four orders of magnitude less than the bandwidth that is used for Ethernet or802.11 (WiFi). Unsurprisingly,the data rates of telephone modems are also fourorders of magnitude less than that of Ethernet and 802.11.Let us run the numbers to see whythis is the case.The Nyquist theorem tellsus that evenwith a perfect 3000-Hz line (which a telephone line is decidedly not),there is no point in sending symbols at a rate faster than 6000 baud.Let us consid-er,for example, an older modem sending at a rate of 2400 symbols/sec, (2400baud) and focus on getting multiple bits per symbol while allowing trafficinbothdirections at the same time (by using different frequencies for different directions).The humble 2400-bps modem uses 0 volts for a logical 0 and 1 volt for a logi-cal 1, with 1 bit per symbol.One step up, it can use four different symbols, as inthe four phases of QPSK, so with 2 bits/symbol it can get a data rate of 4800 bps.Along progression of higher rates has been achievedastechnology has im-proved. Higher rates require a larger set of symbols (see Fig. 2-17).With manysymbols, evenasmall amount of noise in the detected amplitude or phase can re-sult in an error.Toreduce the chance of errors, standards for the higher-speedmodems use some of the symbols for error correction.The schemes are known asTCM(Trellis Coded Modulation). Somecommon modem standards are shownin Fig. 2-27.Modem standardBaud Bits/symbolBpsV.32 240049600V.32 bis2400 614,400V.34 240012 28,800V.34 bis2400 1433,600Figure2-27.Some modem standards and their bit rate.Whydoes it stop at 33,600 bps?The reason is that the Shannon limit for thetelephone system is about 35 kbps based on the average length and quality of localloops. Goingfaster than this would violate the laws of physics (department ofthermodynamics) or require newlocal loops (which is gradually being done).However, there is one way we can change the situation.At the telephone com-panyend office, the data are converted to digital form for transmission within thetelephone network (the core of the telephone network converted from analog todigital long ago).The 35-kbps limit is for the situation in which there are twolocal loops, one at each end. Each of these adds noise to the signal.If we could getrid of one of these local loops, we would increase the SNR and the maximum ratewould be doubled.This approach is how56-kbps modems are made to work.

Thus,when one end of the connection is a high-quality signal, as it iswith most ISPs now, the maximum data rate can be as high as 70 kbps.Betweentwohome users with modems and analog lines, the maximum is still 33.6 kbps.The reason that 56-kbps modems (rather than 70-kbps modems) are in use hasto do with the Nyquist theorem.Atelephone channel is carried inside the tele-phone system as digital samples.Each telephone channel is 4000 Hz wide whenthe guard bands are included.The number of samples per second needed to recon-struct it is thus 8000.The number of bits per sample in North America is 8, ofwhich one is used for control purposes, allowing 56,000 bits/sec of user data.InEurope, all 8 bits are available to users, so 64,000-bit/sec modems could have beenused, but to get international agreement on a standard, 56,000 was chosen.The end result is theV.90andV.92modem standards.Theyprovide for a56-kbps downstream channel (ISP to user) and a 33.6-kbps and 48-kbps upstreamchannel (user to ISP), respectively.The asymmetry is because there is usuallymore data transported from the ISP to the user than the other way.Italso meansthat more of the limited bandwidth can be allocated to the downstream channel toincrease the chances of it actually working at 56 kbps.Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL)When the telephone industry finally got to 56 kbps, it patted itself on the backfor a job well done.Meanwhile, the cable TV industry was offering speeds up to10 Mbps on shared cables.As Internet access became an increasingly importantpart of their business, the local telephone companies begantorealize theyneeded amore competitive product. Theiranswer was to offer newdigital services overthelocal loop.Initially,there were manyoverlapping high-speed offerings, all under the gen-eral name ofxDSL(Digital Subscriber Line), for variousx.Services with morebandwidth than standard telephone service are sometimes referred to asbroad-band,although the term really is more of a marketing concept than a specific tech-nical concept.Later,wewill discuss what has become the most popular of theseservices,ADSL(Asymmetric DSL). Wewill also use the term DSL or xDSL asshorthand for all flavors.The reason that modems are so slowisthat telephones were invented for carry-ing the human voice, and the entire system has been carefully optimized for thispurpose. Datahave always been stepchildren.At the point where each local loopterminates in the end office, the wire runs through a filter that attenuates all fre-quencies below300 Hz and above 3400 Hz.The cutoffisnot sharp—300 Hz and3400 Hz are the 3-dB points—so the bandwidth is usually quoted as 4000 Hz eventhough the distance between the 3 dB points is 3100 Hz.Data on the wire are thusalso restricted to this narrowband.The trick that makes xDSL work is that when a customer subscribes to it, theincoming line is connected to a different kind of switch that does not have this'),\n",

Thelimiting fac-tor then becomes the physics of the local loop, which supports roughly 1 MHz, notthe artificial 3100 Hz bandwidth created by the filter.Unfortunately,the capacity of the local loop falls rather quickly with distancefrom the end office as the signal is increasingly degraded along the wire.It alsodepends on the thickness and general quality of the twisted pair.Aplot of the po-tential bandwidth as a function of distance is giveninFig. 2-28.This figure as-sumes that all the other factors are optimal (newwires, modest bundles, etc.).5040\\n2030\\n1000 1000200030004000Meters50006000\\nMbps\\nFigure2-28.Bandwidth versus distance overCategory 3 UTP for DSL.The implication of this figure creates a problem for the telephone company.When it picks a speed to offer,itissimultaneously picking a radius from its end of-fices beyond which the service cannot be offered.

Butthe lower the speed, the less attrac-tive the service is and the fewer the people who will be willing to pay for it.Thisis where business meets technology.The xDSL services have all been designed with certain goals in mind.First,the services must work overthe existing Category 3 twisted-pair local loops.Sec-ond, theymust not affect customers’ existing telephones and fax machines.Third,theymust be much faster than 56 kbps.Fourth, theyshould be always on, with justamonthly charge and no per-minute charge.To meet the technical goals, the available 1.1-MHz spectrum on the local loopis divided into 256 independent channels of 4312.5 Hz each.This arrangement isshown in Fig.2-29.

A50/50 mix ofupstream and downstream is technically possible, but most providers allocatesomething like80–90% of the bandwidth to the downstream channel since mostusers download more data than theyupload. Thischoice givesrise to the ‘‘A’’ inADSL. Acommon split is 32 channels for upstream and the rest downstream. Itisalso possible to have a few ofthe highest upstream channels be bidirectional for in-creased bandwidth, although making this optimization requires adding a specialcircuit to cancel echoes.The international ADSL standard, known asG.dmt,was approvedin1999.

ADSL2+doubles the downstream throughput to 24 Mbps by doublingthe bandwidth to use 2.2 MHz overthe twisted pair.The next improvement (in 2006) wasVDSL,which pushed the data rate overthe shorter local loops to 52 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps upstream.Then, aseries of newstandards from 2007 to 2011, going under the name ofVDSL2,onhigh-quality local loops managed to use 12-MHz bandwidth and achieve data ratesof 200 Mbps downstream and 100 Mbps upstream.In 2015,Vpluswasproposedfor local loops shorter than 250 m.

Insome places, the telephone wires entering houses use a cable that in fact has twotwisted pairs. The original idea was to allowtwo separate telephone lines and num-bers in the house, but by using pair bonding, a single higher-speed Internet con-nection can be achieved. Increasingnumbers of ISPs in Europe, Australia, Cana-da, and the United States are already deploying a technology calledG.fastthatuses pair bonding. As with other forms of DSL, the performance of G.fast dependson the distance of the transmission; recent tests have seen symmetric speeds ap-proaching 1 Gbps at distances of 100 meters.When coupled with a fiber deploy-ment known asFTTdp(Fiber to the Distribution Point), which brings fiber to adistribution point of several hundred subscribers and uses copper to transmit datathe rest of the way to the home (in VDSL2, this may be up to 1 kilometer,althoughat lower speeds).FTTdp is just one type of fiber deployment that takes fiber fromthe core of the network to some point close to the network edge. The next sectiondescribes various modes of fiber deployment.Fiber ToThe X (FTTX)The speed of last-mile networks is often constrained by the copper cables usedin conventional telephone networks, which cannot transmit data at high rates overas long a distance as fiber.Thus, an ultimate goal, where it is cost effective,istobring fiber all the way to a customer home, sometimes calledFTTH(Fiber to theHome). Telephone companies continue to try to improve the performance of thelocal loop, often by deploying fiber as far as theycan to the home. If not directly tothe home itself, the companymay provideFTTN(Fiber to the Node)(or neigh-borhood), whereby fiber is terminated in a cabinet on a street sometimes severalmiles from the customer home. Fiber to the Distribution Point (FTTdp), as men-tioned above,movesfiber one step closer to the customer home, often bringingfiber to within a fewmeters of the customer premises. In between these options isFTTC(Fiber to the Curb). Allof theseFTTX(Fiber to the X)designs aresometimes also called ‘‘fiber in the loop’’because some amount of fiber is used inthe local loop.Several variations of the form ‘‘FTTX’’(whereXstands for the basement,curb, or neighborhood) exist. Theyare used to note that the fiber deployment mayreach close to the house.In this case, copper (twisted pair or coaxial cable) pro-vides fast enough speeds overthe last short distance.The choice of howfar to lay'),\n",

Inanycase,the point is that optical fiber has crossed the traditional barrier of the ‘‘last mile.’’We will focus on FTTH in our discussion.Likethe copper wires before it, the fiber local loop is passive,which means nopowered equipment is required to amplify or otherwise process signals.The fibersimply carries signals between the home and the end office. This,in turn, reducescost and improvesreliability.Usually,the fibers from the houses are joined toget-her so that only a single fiber reaches the end office per group of up to 100 houses.In the downstream direction, optical splitters divide the signal from the end officeso that it reaches all the houses.Encryption is needed for security if only onehouse should be able to decode the signal.In the upstream direction, optical com-biners merge the signals from the houses into a single signal that is receivedattheend office.This architecture is called aPON(Passive Optical Network), and it is shownin Fig.2-31. Itis common to use one wavelength shared between all the housesfor downstream transmission, and another wavelength for upstream transmission.\\nFiber\\nOpticalsplitter/combinerEnd officeRest ofnetwork\\nFigure2-31.Passive optical network for Fiber ToThe Home.Even with the splitting, the tremendous bandwidth and lowattenuation of fibermean that PONs can provide high rates to users overdistances of up to 20 km. Theactual data rates and other details depend on the type of PON. Two kinds are com-mon.GPONs(Gigabit-capable PONs)come from the world of telecommunica-tions, so theyare defined by an ITU standard.EPONs(Ethernet PONs)are morein tune with the world of networking, so theyare defined by an IEEE standard.Both run at around a gigabit and can carry trafficfor different services, includingInternet, video, and voice. For example, GPONs provide 2.4 Gbps downstreamand 1.2 or 2.4 Gbps upstream.Additional protocols are needed to share the capacity of the single fiber at theend office between the different houses.The downstream direction is quite easy.The end office can send messages to each different house in whateverorder it likes.In the upstream direction, however, messages from different houses cannot be sentat the same time, or different signals would collide.The houses also cannot heareach other’stransmissions so theycannot listen before transmitting.The solution'),\n",

For this to work, there is a ranging process to adjust thetransmission times from the houses so that all the signals receivedatthe end officeare synchronized.The design is similar to cable modems, which we coverlater inthis chapter.For more information on PONs, see Grobe and Elbers (2008) orAndrade et al. (2014).2.5.3 Trunks and MultiplexingTrunks in the telephone network are not only much faster than the local loops,theyare different in twoother respects.The core of the telephone network carriesdigital information, not analog information; that is, bits not voice. Thisnecessi-tates a conversion at the end office to digital form for transmission overthe long-haul trunks.The trunks carry thousands, evenmillions, of calls simultaneously.This sharing is important for achieving economies of scale, since it costs essen-tially the same amount of moneytoinstall and maintain a high-bandwidth trunk asalow-bandwidth trunk between twoswitching offices. Itis accomplished with ver-sions of TDM and FDM.Below, wewill briefly examine howvoice signals are digitized so that theycanbe transported by the telephone network. Afterthat, we will see howTDM is usedto carry bits on trunks, including the TDM system used for fiber optics (SONET).Then, we will turn to FDM as it is applied to fiber optics, which is calledwavelength division multiplexing.Digitizing Voice SignalsEarly in the development of the telephone network, the core handled voicecalls as analog information.FDM techniques were used for manyyears to multi-plex4000-Hz voice channels (each comprising 3100 Hz plus guard bands) intolarger and larger units.Forexample, 12 calls in the 60 kHz–to–108 kHz band areknown as agroup,fivegroups (a total of 60 calls) are known as asupergroup,andso on.These FDM methods are still used oversome copper wires and microwavechannels. However, FDM requires analog circuitry and is not amenable to beingdone by a computer.Incontrast, TDM can be handled entirely by digital elec-tronics, so it has become far more widespread in recent years.Since TDM canonly be used for digital data and the local loops produce analog signals, a conver-sion is needed from analog to digital in the end office, where all the individuallocal loops come together to be combined onto outgoing trunks.The analog signals are digitized in the end office by a device called acodec(short for ‘‘coder-decoder’’) using atechnique is calledPCM(Pulse Code Modu-lation), which forms the heart of the modern telephone system.The codec makes8000 samples per second (125µ sec/sample) because the Nyquist theorem says thatthis is sufficient to capture all the information from the 4-kHz telephone channel'),\n",

Atalower sampling rate, information would be lost; at a higher one,no extra information would be gained. Almostall time intervals within the tele-phone system are multiples of 125µ sec. Thestandard uncompressed data rate foravoice-grade telephone call is thus 8 bits every 125µ sec, or 64 kbps.Each sample of the amplitude of the signal is quantized to an 8-bit number.Toreduce the error due to quantization, the quantization levels are unevenly spaced. Alogarithmic scale is used that givesrelatively more bits to smaller signal ampli-tudes and relatively fewer bits to large signal amplitudes.In this way,the error isproportional to the signal amplitude.Twoversions of quantization are widelyused:µ -law,used in North America and Japan, andA-law,used in Europe and therest of the world. Bothversions are specified in standard ITU G.711.An equiv-alent way to think about this process is to imagine that the dynamic range of thesignal (or the ratio between the largest and smallest possible values) is compressedbefore it is (evenly) quantized, and then expanded when the analog signal isrecreated. For this reason, it is calledcompanding.Itisalso possible to compressthe samples after theyare digitized so that theyrequire much less than 64 kbps.However, wewill leave this topic for when we explore audio applications such asvoice overIP.At the other end of the call, an analog signal is recreated from the quantizedsamples by playing them out (and smoothing them) overtime. Itwill not be exact-ly the same as the original analog signal, eventhough we sampled at the Nyquistrate, because the samples were quantized.T-Carrier: Multiplexing Digital Signals on the Phone NetworkTheT-Carrieris a specification for transmitting multiple TDM channels overasingle circuit.TDM with PCM is used to carry multiple voice calls overtrunksby sending a sample from each call every 125µ sec. Whendigital transmissionbeganemerging as a feasible technology,ITU (then called CCITT) was unable toreach agreement on an international standard for PCM.Consequently,avariety ofincompatible schemes are nowinuse in different countries around the world.The method used in North America and Japan is theT1carrier,depicted inFig. 2-32.(Technically speaking, the format is called DS1 and the carrier is calledT1, but following widespread industry tradition, we will not makethat subtle dis-tinction here.)The T1 carrier consists of 24 voice channels multiplexedtogether.Each of the 24 channels, in turn, gets to insert 8 bits into the output stream.TheT1 carrier was introduced in 1962.Aframe consists of 24× 8=192 bits plus one extra bit for control purposes,yielding 193 bits every 125µ sec. Thisgivesagross data rate of 1.544 Mbps, ofwhich 8 kbps is for signaling.The 193rd bit is used for frame synchronization andsignaling. Inone variation, the 193rd bit is used across a group of 24 frames calledanextended superframe.Six of the bits, in the 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, and24th positions, takeonthe alternating pattern 001011....Normally,the receiver'),\n",

Theearlier versions sent signaling infor-mationin-band,meaning in the same channel as the data, by using some of thedata bits. This design is one form ofchannel-associated signaling,because eachchannel has its own private signaling subchannel.In one arrangement, the leastsignificant bit out of an 8-bit sample on each channel is used in every sixth frame.It has the colorful name ofrobbed-bit signaling.The idea is that a fewstolen bitswill not matter for voice calls.No one will hear the difference.Fordata, however, itisanother story.Delivering the wrong bits is unhelpful,to say the least.If older versions of T1 are used to carry data, only 7 of 8 bits, or56 kbps, can be used in each of the 24 channels.Instead, newer versions of T1provide clear channels in which all of the bits may be used to send data.Clearchannels are what businesses who lease a T1 line want when theysend data acrossthe telephone network in place of voice samples.Signaling for anyvoice calls isthen handledout-of-band,meaning in a separate channel from the data.Often, thesignaling is done withcommon-channel signalingin which there is a shared sig-naling channel.One of the 24 channels may be used for this purpose.Outside of North America and Japan, the 2.048-MbpsE1carrier is used in-stead of T1.This carrier has 32 8-bit data samples packed into the basic 125-µ secframe.

T1and T3 are widely used by customers, whereas T2and T4 are only used within the telephone system itself, so theyare not well-known.Just as there is little agreement on the basic carrier between the United Statesand the rest of the world, there is equally little agreement on howitistobemulti-plexedinto higher-bandwidth carriers.The U.S. scheme of stepping up by 4, 7,and 6 did not strikeeveryone else as the way to go, so the ITU standard calls formultiplexing four streams into one stream at each level.

In1985, Bellcore, the research arm of the Re-gional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), beganworking on a standard, calledSONET(Synchronous Optical NETwork).Later,ITU joined the effort, which resulted in a SONET standard and a set ofparallel ITU recommendations (G.707, G.708, and G.709) in 1989.The ITU rec-ommendations are calledSDH(Synchronous Digital Hierarchy)but differ fromSONET only in minor ways. Virtually all of the long-distance telephone trafficinthe United States, and much of it elsewhere, nowuses trunks running SONET inthe physical layer.For additional information about SONET,see Perros (2005).The SONET design had four major goals:1. Carrierinteroperability: SONET had to makeitpossible for differentcarriers to interoperate.Achieving this goal required defining a com-mon signaling standard with respect to wavelength, timing, framingstructure, and other issues.2. Unification across regions: some means was needed to unify the U.S.,European, and Japanese digital systems, all of which were based on64-kbps PCM channels but combined them in different (and incom-patible) ways.3. Multiplexing digital channels: SONET had to provide a way to multi-plexmultiple digital channels.At the time SONET was devised, thehighest-speed digital carrier actually used widely in the United StateswasT3, at 44.736 Mbps.T4 was defined, but not used much, andnothing was evendefined above T4speed. Part of SONET’smissionwastocontinue the hierarchytogigabits/sec and beyond. Astandardwaytomultiplexslower channels into one SONET channel was alsoneeded.4. Managementsupport: SONET had to provide support for operations,administration, and maintenance (OAM), which are needed to man-age the network. Previous systems did not do this very well.An early decision was to makeSONET a conventional TDM system, with theentire bandwidth of the fiber devoted to one channel containing time slots for thevarious subchannels.As such, SONET is a synchronous system.Each sender andreceiveristied to a common clock.The master clock that controls the system hasan accuracyofabout 1 part in 109.Bits on a SONET line are sent out at extremelyprecise intervals, controlled by the master clock.The basic SONET frame is a block of 810 bytes put out every 125µ sec.

Wehavejust looked at the outside plant.Now, itistime to examine the inside plant.Twodifferent switching techniques are used by the network nowadays: circuitswitching and packet switching.The traditional telephone system is based on cir-cuit switching, although voice overIPtechnology relies on packet switching.Wewill go into circuit switching in some detail and contrast it with packet switching.Both kinds of switching are important enough that we will come back to themwhen we get to the network layer.Circuit SwitchingTraditionally,when you or your computer placed a telephone call, the switch-ing equipment within the telephone system sought out a physical path all the wayfrom your telephone to the receiver’stelephone and maintained it for the durationof the call.This technique is calledcircuit switching.Itisshown schematicallyin Fig.2-36(a). Eachof the six rectangles represents a carrier switching office(end office, toll office, etc.).In this example, each office has three incoming linesand three outgoing lines.When a call passes through a switching office, a physicalconnection is established between the line on which the call came in and one of theoutput lines, as shown by the dotted lines.In the early days of the telephone, the connection was made by the operatorplugging a jumper cable into the input and output sockets. Infact, a surprising lit-tle story is associated with the invention of automatic circuit-switching equipment.It was invented by a 19th-century Missouri undertaker named Almon B. Strowger.Shortly after the telephone was invented, when someone died, one of the survivorswould call the town operator and say ‘‘Please connect me to an undertaker.’’Unfor-tunately for Mr.Strowger,there were twoundertakers in his town, and the otherone’swife was the town telephone operator.Hequickly sawthat either he wasgoing to have toinvent automatic telephone switching equipment or he was goingto go out of business. Hechose the first option.Fornearly 100 years, the cir-cuit-switching equipment used worldwide was known asStrowger gear.(Historydoes not record whether the now-unemployed switchboard operator got a job as aninformation operator,answering questions such as ‘‘What is the phone number ofan undertaker?’’)The model shown in Fig.2-36(a) is highly simplified, of course, because partsof the physical path between the twotelephones may,infact, be microwave orfiberlinks onto which thousands of calls are multiplexed. Nevertheless, the basic idea isvalid: once a call has been set up, a dedicated path between both ends exists andwill continue to exist until the call is finished.An important property of circuit switching is the need to set up an end-to-endpathbeforeanydata can be sent.The elapsed time between the end of dialing andthe start of ringing can sometimes be 10 seconds, more on long-distance or interna-tional calls.During this time interval, the telephone system is hunting for a path,'),\n",

(b) Packet switching.as shown in Fig.2-37(a). Notethat before data transmission can evenbegin, thecall request signal must propagate all the way to the destination and be acknow-ledged. For manycomputer applications (e.g., point-of-sale credit verification),long setup times are undesirable.As a consequence of the reserved path between the calling parties, once thesetup has been completed, the only delay for data is the propagation time for theelectromagnetic signal: about 5 milliseconds per 1000 km.Also, as a consequenceof the established path, there is no danger of congestion—that is, once the call hasbeen put through, you neverget busy signals.Of course, you might get one beforethe connection has been established due to lack of switching or trunk capacity.Packet SwitchingThe alternative tocircuit switching ispacket switching,shown in Fig. 2-36(b)and described in Chap. 1.With this technology,packets are sent as soon as theyare available. Incontrast to circuit switching, there is no need to set up a dedicatedpath in advance. Packet switching is analogous to sending a series of letters usingthe postal system: each one travels independently of the others.It is up to routers'),\n",

Thisprocedure is unlikecircuit switching, where the resultof the connection setup is the reservation of bandwidth all the way from the senderto the receiverand all data on the circuit follows this path.In circuit switching,having all the data followthe same path means that it cannot arrive out of order.With packet switching, there is no fixed path, so different packets can followdif-ferent paths, depending on network conditions at the time theyare sent, and theymay arrive out of order.Packet-switching networks place a tight upper limit on the size of packets.This ensures that no user can monopolize anytransmission line for very long (e.g.,manymilliseconds), so that packet-switched networks can handle interactive traf-fic. Italso reduces delay since the first packet of a long message can be forwardedbefore the second one has fully arrived. However, the store-and-forward delay ofaccumulating a packet in the router’smemory before it is sent on to the next router'),\n",

With circuit switching, the bits just flowthroughthe wire continuously.Nothing is everstored and forwarded later.Packet and circuit switching also differ in other ways. Becauseno bandwidthis reserved with packet switching, packets may have towait to be forwarded. Thisintroducesqueueing delayand congestion if manypackets are sent at the sametime. Onthe other hand, there is no danger of getting a busy signal and beingunable to use the network. Thus,congestion occurs at different times with circuitswitching (at setup time) and packet switching (when packets are sent).If a circuit has been reserved for a particular user and there is no traffic, itsbandwidth is wasted. Itcannot be used for other traffic. Packet switching does notwaste bandwidth and thus is more efficient from a system perspective.Under-standing this trade-offiscrucial for comprehending the difference between circuitswitching and packet switching.The trade-offisbetween guaranteed service andwasting resources versus not guaranteeing service and not wasting resources.Packet switching is more fault tolerant than circuit switching.In fact, that iswhyitwas invented. Ifaswitch goes down, all of the circuits using it are termi-nated and no more trafficcan be sent on anyofthem. With packet switching,packets can be routed around dead switches.Another difference between circuit and packet switching is howtrafficisbilled. With circuit switching (i.e., for voice telephone calls overthe PSTN),billing has historically been based on distance and time.Formobile voice, dis-tance usually does not play a role, except for international calls, and time playsonly a coarse role (e.g., a calling plan with 2000 free minutes costs more than onewith 1000 free minutes and sometimes nights or weekends are cheap).With pack-et-switched networks, including both fixed-line and mobile networks, time con-nected is not an issue, but the volume of trafficis. For home users in the UnitedStates and Europe, ISPs usually charge a flat monthly rate because it is less workfor them and their customers can understand this model. In some developing coun-tries, billing is often still volume-based: users may purchase a ‘‘data bundle’’ofacertain size and use that data overthe course of a billing cycle. Certaintimes ofday,orevencertain destinations, may be free of charge or not count against thedata cap or quota; these services are sometimes calledzero-rated services.Gener-ally,carrier Internet service providers in the Internet backbone charge based ontrafficvolumes. A typical billing model is based on the 95th percentile of five-minute samples: on a givenlink, an ISP will measure the volume of trafficthat haspassed overthe link in the last fiveminutes. A30-day billing cycle will have 8640such five-minute intervals, and the ISP will bill based on the 95th percentile ofthese samples. This technique is often called95th percentile billing.The differences between circuit switching and packet switching are summa-rized in Fig.2-38. Traditionally,telephone networks have used circuit switching toprovide high-quality telephone calls, and computer networks have used packetswitching for simplicity and efficiency. However, there are notable exceptions.Some older computer networks have been circuit switched under the covers (e.g.,'),\n",

Thecellsare normally roughly circular,but theyare easier to model as hexagons. InFig. 2-39(a),the cells are all the same size.Theyare grouped in units of sevencells. Eachletter indicates a group of frequencies.Notice that for each frequencyset, there is a buffer about twocells wide where that frequencyisnot reused, pro-viding for good separation and lowinterference.\\nGFABCDE\\nGFABCDEGFABCDE(a) (b)Figure2-39.(a) Frequencies are not reused in adjacent cells.(b) Toadd moreusers, smaller cells can be used.In an area where the number of users has grown to the point that the system isoverloaded, the power can be reduced and the overloaded cells split into smallermicrocellsto permit more frequencyreuse, as shown in Fig.2-39(b). Telephonecompanies sometimes create temporary microcells, using portable towers with sat-ellite links at sporting events, rock concerts, and other places where large numbersof mobile users congregate for a fewhours.At the center of each cell is a base station to which all the telephones in the celltransmit.

Inalarger one, several MSCs may be needed, all ofwhich are connected to a second-levelMSC, and so on.The MSCs are essentiallyend offices as in the telephone system, and are in fact connected to at least onetelephone system end office. TheMSCs communicate with the base stations, eachother,and the PSTN using a packet-switching network.At anyinstant, each mobile telephone is logically in one specific cell and underthe control of that cell’sbase station.When a mobile telephone physically leavesacell, its base station notices the telephone’ssignal fading awayand then asks all thesurrounding base stations howmuch power theyare getting from it.When theanswers come back, the base station then transfers ownership to the cell getting thestrongest signal; under most conditions that is the cell where the telephone is nowlocated. Thetelephone is then informed of its newboss, and if a call is in progress,it is asked to switch to a newchannel (because the old one is not reused in anyofthe adjacent cells).This process, calledhandoff,takes about 300 milliseconds.Channel assignment is done by the MSC, the nervecenter of the system.The basestations are really just dumb radio relays.Finding locations high in the air to place base station antennas is a major issue.This problem has led some telecommunication carriers to forge alliances with theRoman Catholic Church, since the latter owns a substantial number of exalted po-tential antenna sites worldwide, all conveniently under a single management.Cellular networks typically have four types ofchannels.Control channels(base to mobile) are used to manage the system.Paging channels(base to mobile)alert mobile users to calls for them.Access channels(bidirectional) are used forcall setup and channel assignment.Finally,data channels(bidirectional) carryvoice, fax, or data.2.6.2 First-Generation(1G) Technology: Analog VoiceLet us look at cellular network technology,starting with the earliest system.Mobile radiotelephones were used sporadically for maritime and military commu-nication during the early decades of the 20th century.In1946, the first system forcar-based telephones was set up in St. Louis.This system used a single large trans-mitter on top of a tall building and had a single channel, used for both sending andreceiving. Totalk, the user had to push a button that enabled the transmitter anddisabled the receiver. Such systems, known aspush-to-talk systems,were in-stalled beginning in the 1950s.Taxis and police cars often used this technology.In the 1960s,IMTS(ImprovedMobile Telephone System)was installed.It,too, used a high-powered (200-watt) transmitter on top of a hill but it had twofre-quencies, one for sending and one for receiving, so the push-to-talk button was nolonger needed.Since all communication from the mobile telephones went inboundon a different channel than the outbound signals, the mobile users could not heareach other (unlikethe push-to-talk system used in older taxis).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 180}, page_content='SEC. 2.6 CELLULAR NETWORKS 157IMTS supported 23 channels spread out from 150 MHz to 450 MHz.Due tothe small number of channels, users often had to wait a long time before getting adial tone.Also, due to the large power of the hilltop transmitters, adjacent systemshad to be several hundred kilometers apart to avoid interference.All in all, thelimited capacity made the system impractical.AMPS(Advanced Mobile Phone System), an analog mobile phone systeminvented by Bell Labs and first deployed in the United States in 1983, significantlyincreased the capacity of the cellular network. Itwasalso used in England, whereit was called TACS, and in Japan, where it was called MCS-L1.AMPS was for-mally retired in 2008, but we will look at it to understand the context for the 2Gand 3G systems that improvedonit. InAMPS, cells are typically 10 to 20 kmacross; in digital systems, the cells are smaller.Whereas an IMTS system 100 kmacross can have only one call on each frequency, anAMPS system might have 10010-km cells in the same area and be able to have 10to15calls on each frequency,in widely separated cells.AMPS uses FDM to separate the channels.The system uses 832 full-duplexchannels, each consisting of a pair of simplexchannels. Thisarrangement isknown asFDD(Frequency Division Duplex). The832 simplexchannels from824 to 849 MHz are used for mobile to base station transmission, and 832 simplexchannels from 869 to 894 MHz are used for base station to mobile transmission.Each of these simplexchannels is 30 kHz wide.The 832 channels in AMPS are divided into four categories. Sincethe samefrequencies cannot be reused in nearby cells and 21 channels are reserved in eachcell for control, the actual number of voice channels available per cell is muchsmaller than 832, typically about 45.Call ManagementEach mobile telephone in AMPS has a 32-bit serial number and a 10-digit tele-phone number in its programmable read-only memory.The telephone number inmanycountries is represented as a 3-digit area code in 10 bits and a 7-digit sub-scriber number in 24 bits.When a phone is switched on, it scans a preprogrammedlist of 21 control channels to find the most powerful signal.The phone then broad-casts its 32-bit serial number and 34-bit telephone number.Likeall the controlinformation in AMPS, this packet is sent in digital form, multiple times, and withan error-correcting code, eventhough the voice channels themselves are analog.When the base station hears the announcement, it tells the MSC, which recordsthe existence of its newcustomer and also informs the customer’shome MSC ofhis current location.During normal operation, the mobile telephone reregistersabout once every 15 minutes.To makeacall, a mobile user switches on the phone, (at least conceptually)enters the number to be called on the keypad, and hits the CALL button. Thephone then transmits the number to be called and its own identity on the access'),\n",

Ifacollision occurs there, it tries again later.When the base station getsthe request, it informs the MSC.If the caller is a customer of the MSC’scompany(or one of its partners), the MSC looks for an idle channel for the call.If one isfound, the channel number is sent back on the control channel.The mobile phonethen automatically switches to the selected voice channel and waits until the calledparty picks up the phone.Incoming calls work differently.Tostart with, all idle phones continuously lis-ten to the paging channel to detect messages directed at them.When a call isplaced to a mobile phone (either from a fixed phone or another mobile phone), apacket is sent to the callee’shome MSC to find out where it is.Apacket is thensent to the base station in its current cell, which sends a broadcast on the pagingchannel of the form ‘‘Unit 14, are you there?’’The called phone responds with a‘‘Yes’’onthe access channel.The base then says something like: ‘‘Unit 14, callfor you on channel 3.’’ Atthis point, the called phone switches to channel 3 andstarts making ringing sounds (or playing some melody the owner was givenasabirthday present).2.6.3 Second-Generation(2G) Technology: Digital VoiceThe first generation of mobile phones was analog; the second generation isdigital. Switching to digital has several advantages. Itprovides capacity gains byallowing voice signals to be digitized and compressed. It improvessecurity by al-lowing voice and control signals to be encrypted.This, in turn, deters fraud andeavesdropping, whether from intentional scanning or echoes of other calls due toRF propagation. Finally,itenables newservices such as text messaging.Just as there was no worldwide standardization during the first generation,there was also no worldwide standardization during the second, either.Several dif-ferent systems were developed, and three have been widely deployed.D-AMPS(Digital Advanced Mobile Phone System)isadigital version of AMPS thatcoexists with AMPS and uses TDM to place multiple calls on the same frequencychannel. Itis described in International Standard IS-54 and its successor IS-136.GSM(Global System for Mobile communications)has emerged as the dominantsystem, and while it was slowtocatch on in the United States it is nowused virtu-ally everywhere in the world. LikeD-AMPS, GSM is based on a mix of FDM andTDM.CDMA(Code Division Multiple Access), described inInternationalStandard IS-95,isacompletely different kind of system and is based on neitherFDM nor TDM.While CDMA has not become the dominant 2G system, its tech-nology has become the basis for 3G systems.Also, the namePCS(Personal Communications Services)issometimes usedin the marketing literature to indicate a second-generation (i.e., digital) system.Originally it meant a mobile phone using the 1900 MHz band, but that distinctionis rarely made now. The dominant 2G system in most of the world is GSM whichwe nowdescribe in detail.'),\n",

It soon became clear that GSM was going to be morethan a European success, with the uptakestretching to countries as far awayasAustralia, so GSM was renamed to have a more worldwide appeal.GSM and the other mobile phone systems we will study retain from 1G sys-tems a design based on cells, frequencyreuse across cells, and mobility with hand-offs as subscribers move.Itisthe details that differ.Here, we will briefly discusssome of the main properties of GSM.However, the printed GSM standard is over5000 [sic] pages long.Alarge fraction of this material relates to engineering as-pects of the system, especially the design of receivers to handle multipath signalpropagation, and synchronizing transmitters and receivers. Noneof this will beevenmentioned here.Fig. 2-40shows that the GSM architecture is similar to the AMPS architecture,though the components have different names.The mobile itself is nowdividedinto the handset and a removable chip with subscriber and account informationcalled aSIM card,short forSubscriber Identity Module.Itisthe SIM card thatactivates the handset and contains secrets that let the mobile and the network ident-ify each other and encrypt conversations.

It is called theHLR(Home Location Register). Thisdatabase isused to route incoming calls to the right locations.Both databases must be kept upto date as mobiles move from cell to cell.We will nowdescribe the air interface in some detail.GSM runs on a range offrequencies worldwide, including 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz. More spectrum is al-located than for AMPS in order to support a much larger number of users. GSM isafrequencydivision duplexcellular system, likeAMPS. Thatis, each mobiletransmits on one frequencyand receivesonanother,higher frequency(55 MHzhigher for GSM versus 80 MHz higher for AMPS).However, unlikewith AMPS,with GSM a single frequencypair is split by time division multiplexing into timeslots. Inthis way,itisshared by multiple mobiles.To handle multiple mobiles, GSM channels are much wider than the AMPSchannels (200 kHz versus 30 kHz).One 200-kHz channel is shown in Fig.2-41.AGSM system operating in the 900-MHz region has 124 pairs of simplexchan-nels. Eachsimplexchannel is 200 kHz wide and supports eight separate con-nections on it, using time division multiplexing. Eachcurrently active station is as-signed one time slot on one channel pair.Theoretically,992 channels can be sup-ported in each cell, but manyofthem are not available, to avoid frequencyconflictswith neighboring cells.In Fig.2-41, the eight shaded time slots all belong to thesame connection, four of them in each direction.Transmitting and receiving doesnot happen in the same time slot because the GSM radios cannot transmit and re-ceive atthe same time and it takes time to switch from one to the other.Ifthemobile device assigned to 890.4/935.4 MHz and time slot 2 wanted to transmit tothe base station, it would use the lower four shaded slots (and the ones followingthem in time), putting some data in each slot until all the data had been sent.The TDM slots shown in Fig.2-41 are part of a complexframing hierarchy.Each TDM slot has a specific structure, and groups of TDM slots form multi-frames, also with a specific structure.Asimplified version of this hierarchyisshown in Fig.2-42. Herewe can see that each TDM slot consists of a 148-bit dataframe that occupies the channel for 577µ sec (including a 30-µ sec guard time aftereach slot).Each data frame starts and ends with three 0 bits, for frame delineationpurposes. Italso contains two57-bitInformationfields, each one having a controlbit that indicates whether the followingInformationfield is for voice or data.Be-tween theInformationfields is a 26-bitSync(training) field that is used by the re-ceivertosynchronize to the sender’sframe boundaries.Adata frame is transmitted in 547µ sec, but a transmitter is only allowed tosend one data frame every 4.615 msec, since it is sharing the channel with sevenother stations.The gross rate of each channel is 270,833 bps, divided among eightusers.

Anumber of factors drove the industryto 3G technology.First, around the time of 3G, data trafficbegantoexceed voicetrafficonthe fixed network; similar trends begantoemerge for mobile devices.Second, phone, Internet, and video services begantoconverge. The rise of smart-phones, starting with Apple’siPhone, which was first released in 2007, acceleratedthe shift to mobile data.Data volumes are rising steeply with the popularity ofiPhones. Whenthe iPhone was first released, it used a2.5Gnetwork (essentiallyan enhanced 2G network) that did not have enough data capacity.Data-hungryiPhone users further drove the transition to 3G technologies, to support higher datatransmission rates. A year later,in2008, Apple released an updated version of itsiPhone that could use the 3G data network.'),\n",

EDGE is one step along an evolutionary path that is defined from GSM toother 3G technologies that we discuss in this section.ITU tried to get a bit more specific about the 3G vision starting back around1992. It issued a blueprint for getting there calledIMT-2000,where IMT stood forInternational Mobile Telecommunications.The basic services that theIMT-2000 network was supposed to provide to its users are:1. High-qualityvoice transmission.2. Messaging(replacing email, fax, SMS, chat, etc.).3. Multimedia(playing music, viewing videos, films, television, etc.).4. Internetaccess (Web surfing, including pages with audio and video).Additional services might be video conferencing, telepresence, group game play-ing, and m-commerce (waving your telephone at the cashier to pay in a store).Furthermore, all these services are supposed to be available worldwide (with auto-matic connection via a satellite when no terrestrial network can be located), in-stantly (always on), and with quality of service guarantees.In other words, pie inthe sky.ITU envisioned a single worldwide technology for IMT-2000, so manufact-urers could build a single device that could be sold and used anywhere in theworld. Having a single technology would also makelife much simpler for networkoperators and would encourage more people to use the services.As it turned out, this was more than a bit optimistic.The number 2000 stoodfor three things: (1) the year it was supposed to go into service, (2) the frequencyitwassupposed to operate at (in MHz), and (3) the bandwidth the service shouldhave (in kbps).It did not makeitonany ofthe three counts.Nothing was imple-mented by 2000.ITU recommended that all governments reservespectrum at2GHz so devices could roam seamlessly from country to country.China reservedthe required bandwidth but nobody else did.Finally,itwas recognized that2Mbps is not currently feasible for users who aretoomobile (due to the difficultyof performing handoffs quickly enough).More realistic is 2 Mbps for stationaryindoor users, 384 kbps for people walking, and 144 kbps for connections in cars.Despite these initial setbacks, a great deal has been accomplished since then.Several IMT-2000 proposals were made and, after some winnowing, it came downto twoprimary ones: (1)WCDMA(Wideband CDMA), proposed by Ericsson'),\n",

Ifthe Ericsson and Qualcomm engineers were put in a room and told tocome to a common design, theyprobably could find one in an hour.The trouble isthat the real problem is not engineering, but politics (as usual).Europe wanted asystem that interworked with GSM, whereas the United States wanted a systemthat was compatible with one already widely deployed in the United States (IS-95).Each side (naturally) also supported its local company(Ericsson is based in Swe-den; Qualcomm is in California).Finally,Ericsson and Qualcomm were involvedin numerous lawsuits overtheir respective CDMA patents.To add to the confu-sion, UMTS became a single 3G standard with multiple incompatible options, in-cluding CDMA2000.This change was an effort to unify the various camps, but itjust papers overthe technical differences and obscures the focus of ongoing efforts.We will use UMTS to mean WCDMA, as distinct from CDMA2000.Another improvement of WCDMA overthe simplified CDMA scheme we de-scribed earlier is to allowdifferent users to send data at different rates, independentof each other.This trick is accomplished naturally in CDMA by fixing the rate atwhich chips are transmitted and assigning different users chip sequences of dif-ferent lengths.Forexample, in WCDMA, the chip rate is 3.84 Mchips/sec and thespreading codes vary from 4 to 256 chips. With a 256-chip code, around 12 kbps isleft after error correction, and this capacity is sufficient for a voice call. With a4-chip code, the user data rate is close to 1 Mbps. Intermediate-length codes giveintermediate rates; in order to get to multiple Mbps, the mobile must use more thanone 5-MHz channel at once.We will focus our discussion on the use of CDMA in cellular networks, as it isthe distinguishing feature of both systems.CDMA is neither FDM nor TDM but akind of mix in which each user sends on the same frequencyband at the same time.When it was first proposed for cellular systems, the industry gaveit approximatelythe same reaction that Columbus first got from Queen Isabella when he proposedreaching India by sailing in the wrong direction.However, through the persistenceof a single company, Qualcomm, CDMA succeeded as a 2G system (IS-95) andmatured to the point that it became the technical basis for 3G.To makeCDMA work in the mobile phone setting requires more than the basicCDMA technique that we described in Sec.2.4. Specifically,wedescribed a sys-tem calledsynchronous CDMA,inwhich the chip sequences are exactly orthogo-nal. This design works when all users are synchronized on the start time of theirchip sequences, as in the case of the base station transmitting to mobiles.The basestation can transmit the chip sequences starting at the same time so that the signalswill be orthogonal and able to be separated.However, itisdifficult to synchronizethe transmissions of independent mobile phones.Without some special efforts,'),\n",

Theyhavetheproperty that, with high probability,theyhavealowcross-correlationwith eachother at all offsets. Thismeans that when one sequence is multiplied by anothersequence and summed up to compute the inner product, the result will be small; itwould be zero if theywere orthogonal.(Intuitively,random sequences should al-ways look different from each other.Multiplying them together should then pro-duce a random signal, which will sum to a small result.)This lets a receiverfilterunwanted transmissions out of the receivedsignal. Also,theauto-correlationofpseudorandom sequences is also small, with high probability,except at a zero off-set. Thismeans that when one sequence is multiplied by a delayed copyofitselfand summed, the result will be small, except when the delay is zero.(Intuitively,adelayed random sequence looks likeadifferent random sequence, and we are backto the cross-correlation case.)This lets a receiverlock onto the beginning of thewanted transmission in the receivedsignal.The use of pseudorandom sequences lets the base station receive CDMA mes-sages from unsynchronized mobiles.However, animplicit assumption in our dis-cussion of CDMA is that the power levels of all mobiles are the same at the re-ceiver. Iftheyare not, a small cross-correlation with a powerful signal might over-whelm a large auto-correlation with a weak signal.Thus, the transmit power onmobiles must be controlled to minimize interference between competing signals.It is this interference that limits the capacity of CDMA systems.The power levels receivedatabase station depend on howfar awaythe trans-mitters are as well as howmuch power theytransmit. Theremay be manymobilestations at varying distances from the base station.Agood heuristic to equalize thereceivedpower is for each mobile station to transmit to the base station at theinverse of the power levelitreceivesfrom the base station.In other words, amobile station receiving a weak signal from the base station will use more powerthan one getting a strong signal.Formore accuracy, the base station also giveseach mobile feedback to increase, decrease, or hold steady its transmit power.Thefeedback is frequent (1500 times per second) because good power control is impor-tant to minimize interference.Nowlet us describe the advantages of CDMA.First, CDMA can improve ca-pacity by taking advantage of small periods when some transmitters are silent. Inpolite voice calls, one party is silent while the other talks. On average, the line isbusy only 40% of the time.However, the pauses may be small and are difficult topredict. With TDM or FDM systems, it is not possible to reassign time slots or fre-quencychannels quickly enough to benefit from these small silences. However, inCDMA, by simply not transmitting one user lowers the interference for other users,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 189}, page_content='166 THE PHYSICAL LAYER CHAP.2and it is likely that some fraction of users will not be transmitting in a busy cell atanygiventime. Thus CDMA takes advantage of expected silences to allowalargernumber of simultaneous calls.Second, with CDMA each cell uses the same set of frequencies.UnlikeGSMand AMPS, FDM is not needed to separate the transmissions of different users.This eliminates complicated frequencyplanning tasks and improvescapacity.Italso makes it easy for a base station to use multiple directional antennas, orsec-tored antennas,instead of an omnidirectional antenna.Directional antennas con-centrate a signal in the intended direction and reduce the signal (and interference)in other directions. This, in turn, increases capacity.Three-sector designs are com-mon. The base station must track the mobile as it movesfrom sector to sector.This tracking is easy with CDMA because all frequencies are used in all sectors.Third, CDMA facilitatessoft handoff,inwhich the mobile is acquired by thenewbase station before the previous one signs off. Inthis way,there is no loss ofcontinuity.Soft handoffisshown in Fig.2-43. Itis easy with CDMA because allfrequencies are used in each cell.The alternative isahard handoff,inwhich theold base station drops the call before the newone acquires it.If the newone isunable to acquire it (e.g., because there is no available frequency), the call isdisconnected abruptly.Users tend to notice this, but it is inevitable occasionallywith the current design.Hard handoffisthe norm with FDM designs to avoid thecost of having the mobile transmit or receive ontwo frequencies simultaneously.\\n(a) (b) (c)Figure2-43.Soft handoff(a) before, (b) during, and (c) after.2.6.6 Fourth-Generation (4G) Technology: Packet SwitchingIn 2008, the ITU specified a set of standards for 4G systems.4G,which issometimes also calledIMT Advancedis based completely on packet-switchednetwork technology,including to its predecessors. Its immediate predecessor was atechnology often referred to asLTE(Long Term Evolution). Anotherprecursorand related technology to 4G was 3GPP LTE, sometimes called ‘‘4G LTE.’’ Theterminology is a bit confusing, as ‘‘4G’’effectively refers to a generation of mobilecommunications, where anygeneration may,infact, have multiple standards. Forexample, ITU considers IMT Advanced as a 4G standard, although it also acceptsLTEasa4Gstandard. Other technologies such as the doomed WiMAX (IEEE'),\n",

Technically,LTE and ‘‘true’’4Garedifferent releases of the 3GPP standard (releases 8 and 10, respectively).The main innovation of 4G overprevious 3G systems is that 4G networks usepacket switching, as opposed to circuit switching.The innovation that allowspacket switching is called anEPC(Evolved Packet Core), which is essentially asimplified IP network that separates voice trafficfrom the data network. The EPCnetwork carries both voice and data in IP packets. It is thus a (VoIP)Voice overIPnetwork, with resources allocated using the statistical multiplexing approaches de-scribed earlier.Assuch, the EPC must manage resources in such a way that voicequality remains high in the face of network resources that are shared among manyusers. The performance requirements for LTE include, among other things, peakthroughput of 100 Mbps upload and 50 Mbps download. Toachieve these higherrates, 4G networks use a collection of additional frequencies, including 700 MHz,850 MHz, 800 MHz, and others. Another aspect of the 4G standard is ‘‘spectral ef-ficiency,’’ orhow manybits can be transmitted per second for a givenfrequency;for 4G technologies, peak spectral efficiencyshould be 15 bps/Hz for a downlinkand 6.75 bps/Ghz for uplink.The LTE architecture includes the following elements as part of the EvolvedPacket Core, as shown in Chap. 1 as Fig. 1-19.1.Serving Gateway(S-GW). TheSGW forwards data packets toensure that packets continue to be forwarded to the user’sdevicewhen switching from one eNodeB to another.2.MME(Mobility Management Entity). TheMME tracks and pagesthe user device and chooses the SGW for a device when it first con-nects to the network, as well as during handoffs. It also authenticatesthe user’sdevice.3.Packet Data Network Gateway(P-GW). ThePDN GW interfacesbetween the user device and a packet data network (i.e., a pack-et-switched network), and can perform such functions such as addressallocation for that network (e.g., via DHCP), rate limiting, filtering,deep packet inspection, and lawful interception of traffic. User de-vices establish connection-oriented service with the packet gatewayusing a so-calledEPS bearer,which is established when the user de-vice attaches to the network.4.HSS(Home Subscriber Server), The MME queries the HSS to de-termine that the user device corresponds to a valid subscriber.The 4G network also has an evolvedRadio Access Network(RAN). Theradio access network for LTE introduces an access node called aneNodeB,whichperforms operations at the physical layer (as we focus on in this chapter), as wellas theMAC(Medium Access Control),RLC(Radio Link Control), andPDCP'),\n",

Obviously,after 4G comes 5G.The realquestion, of course, is ‘‘What Will 5G Be?’’which Andrews et al. (2014) discuss atlength. Years later,5Gcame to mean manydifferent things, depending on theaudience and who is using the term.Essentially,the next generation of mobile cel-lular network technology boils down to twomain factors: higher data rates andlower latencythan 4G technologies. There are specific technologies that enablefaster speed and lower latency, ofcourse, which we discuss below.Cellular network performance is often measured in terms ofaggregate datarateorarea capacity,which is the total amount of data that the network can servein bits per unit area.One goal of 5G is to improve the area capacity of the networkby three orders of magnitude (more than 1000 times that of 4G), using a combina-tion of technologies:1. Ultra-densification and offloading. One of the most straightforwardways to improve network capacity is by adding more cells per area.Whereas 1G cell sizes were on the order of hundreds of square kilo-meters, 5G aims for smaller cell sizes, includingpicocells(cells thatare less than 100 meters in diameter) and evenfemtocells(cells thathave WiFi-likerange of tens of meters).One of the most importantbenefits of the shrinking of the cell size is the ability to reuse spec-trum in a givengeographic area, thus reducing the number of usersthat are competing for resources at anygivenbase station. Of course,shrinking the cell size comes with its own set of complications, in-cluding more complicated mobility management and handoff.2. Increasedbandwidth with millimeter waves. Most spectrum from pre-vious technologies has been in the range of several hundred MHz to afewGHz, corresponding to wavelengths that are in range of centime-ters to about a meter.This spectrum has become increasinglycrowded, especially in major markets during peak hours. There areconsiderable amounts of unused spectrum in the millimeter waverange of 20< 300 GHz, with wavelengths of less than 10 millimeters.Until recently,this spectrum was not considered suitable for wireless'),\n",

One of the ways that propagation challenges are being tackled isby using large arrays of directional antennas, which is a significantarchitectural shift from previous generations of cellular networks:everything from interference properties to theprocess of associatingauser to a base station is different.3. Increasedspectral efficiencythrough advances in massiveMIMO(Multiple-Input Multiple-Output)technology.MIMO improvesthecapacity of a radio link by using multiple transmit and receive anten-nas to takeadvantage of multipath propagation, whereby the trans-mitted radio signal reaches the receivervia twoormore paths. MIMOwasintroduced into WiFi communication and 3G cellular technolo-gies around 2006. MIMO has quite a fewvariations; earlier cellularstandards takeadvantage ofMU-MIMO(Multi-User MIMO). Gen-erally,these technologies takeadvantage of the spatial diversity ofusers to cancel out interference that may occur at either end of thewireless transmission.Massive MIMOis a type of MU-MIMO thatincreases the number of base station antennas so that there are manymore antennas than endpoints.There is eventhe possibility of using athree-dimensional antenna array,inaso-calledFD-MIMO(Full-Dimension MIMO).Another capability that will accompany5Gisnetwork slicing,which will letcellular carriers create multiple virtual networks on top of the same shared physicalinfrastructure, devoting portions of their network to specific customer use cases.Distinct fractions of the network (and its resources) may be dedicated to differentapplication providers, where different applications may have different re-quirements. For example, applications that require high throughput may be allo-cated to a different network slice than those that do not require high throughput.SDN(Software-Defined Networking)andNFV(Network Functions Virtualiza-tion)are emerging technologies that will help support slicing. Wewill discussthese technologies in later chapters.2.7 CABLENETWORKSThe fixed and wireless phone systems will clearly play a role in future net-works, but the cable networks will also factor heavily into future broadband accessnetworks.

Itwasvery much a mom-and-pop operation; anyone handy with elec-tronics could set up a service for his town, and the users would chip in to pay thecosts. Asthe number of subscribers grew, additional cables were spliced onto theoriginal cable and amplifiers were added as needed.Transmission was one way,from the headend to the users.By 1970, thousands of independent systemsexisted.In 1974, Time Inc. started a newchannel, Home Box Office, with newcontent(movies) distributed only on cable.Other cable-only channels followed, focusingon news, sports, cooking, history,movies, science, kids, and manyother topics.This development gaverise to twochanges in the industry.First, large corpora-tions beganbuying up existing cable systems and laying newcable to acquire newsubscribers. Second,there was nowaneed to connect multiple systems, often indistant cities, in order to distribute the newcable channels.The cable companiesbegantolay cable between the cities to connect them all into a single system.Thispattern was analogous to what happened in the telephone industry 80 years earlierwith the connection of previously isolated end offices to makelong-distance cal-ling possible.2.7.2 Broadband Internet Access Over Cable: HFC NetworksOver the course of the years the cable system grewand the cables between thevarious cities were replaced by high-bandwidth fiber,similar to what happened inthe telephone system.Asystem with fiber for the long-haul runs and coaxial cable'),\n",

Thetrend of moving fiber closer tothe subscriber home continues, as described in the earlier section on FTTX.Theelectro-optical converters that interface between the optical and electrical parts ofthe network are calledfiber nodes.Because the bandwidth of fiber is so muchgreater than that of coax, a single fiber node can feed multiple coaxial cables.Partof a modern HFC system is shown in Fig. 2-45(a).\\nCoppertwisted pair\\nSwitch\\nTolloffice\\nHead-end\\nHigh-bandwidthfiber trunkEndofficeLocalloop\\n(a)\\n(b)\\nHouse\\nHigh-bandwidthfibertrunk Coaxialcable\\nHouseTap\\nFiber node\\nFiber\\nFiber\\nFigure2-45.(a) Hybrid Fiber-Coax cable network.

For one thing, all the one-way amplifiers in the system had to be replacedby two-way amplifiers to support upstream as well as downstream transmissions.While this was happening, early Internet overcable systems used the cable televis-ion network for downstream transmissions and a dial-up connection via the tele-phone network for upstream transmissions.It was a kludge if everthere was one,butitsort of worked.Throwing offall the TV channels and using the cable infrastructure strictly forInternet access would probably generate a fair number of irate customers (mostlyolder customers, since manyyounger ones have already cut the cord), so cablecompanies are hesitant to do this.Furthermore, most cities heavily regulate what ison the cable, so the cable operators would not be allowed to do this eveniftheyreally wanted to.As a consequence, theyneeded to find a way to have televisionand Internet peacefully coexist on the same cable.The solution is to build on frequencydivision multiplexing. Cabletelevisionchannels in North America occupythe 54–550 MHz region (except for FM radio,from 88 to 108 MHz).These channels are 6-MHz wide, including guard bands,and can carry one traditional analog television channel or several digital televisionchannels. InEurope, the lowend is usually around 65 MHz and the channels are6–8 MHz wide for the higher resolution required by PAL and SECAM, but other-wise the allocation scheme is similar.The lowpart of the band is not used.Mod-ern cables can also operate well above 550 MHz, often at up to 750 MHz or more.The solution chosen was to introduce upstream channels in the 5–42-MHz band(slightly higher in Europe) and use the frequencies at the high end for the down-stream signals.The cable spectrum is illustrated in Fig. 2-46.0 108TV TV Downstream dataDownstream frequencies\\nUpstreamdataUpstreamfrequenciesFM 550 750 MHz5425488\\nFigure2-46.Frequencyallocation in a typical cable TV system used for Internetaccess.Because the television signals are all downstream, it is possible to useupstream amplifiers that work only in the 5–42-MHz region and downstreamamplifiers that work only at 54 MHz and up, as shown in the figure.

Onthe other hand, most users wantmore downstream traffic, so cable operators are not unhappywith this fact of life.As we sawearlier,telephone companies usually offer an asymmetric DSL service,eventhough theyhaveno technical reason for doing so.In addition to upgradingthe amplifiers, the operator has to upgrade the headend, too, from a dumb amplifierto an intelligent digital computer system with a high-bandwidth fiber interface toan ISP.This upgraded headend is nowsometimes called aCMTS(Cable ModemTermination System). TheCMTS and headend refer to the same component.2.7.3 DOCSISCable companies operate networks that include HFC physical-layer technologyfor last-mile connectivity,aswell as fiber and wireless last-mile connections. TheHFC part of those networks is widely deployed across the United States, Canada,Europe, and other markets, and use the CableLabsDOCSIS(Data Over CableService Interface Specification)standards.DOCSIS version 1.0 was released in 1997. DOCSIS 1.0 and 1.1 had a workinglimit of 38 Mbps downstream and 9 Mbps upstream DOCSIS 2.0 in 2001 resultedin a tripling of upstream bandwidth. Later,DOCSIS 3.0 (2006) introduced supportfor IPv6 and enabled channel bonding for downstream and upstream communica-tions, dramatically increasing the potential capacity for each home served to hun-dreds of megabits per second. DOCSIS 3.1 (2013), which introduced OrthogonalFrequencyDivision Multiplexing (OFDM), wider channel bandwidth and higherefficiency, enabled over1Gbps of downstream capacity per home.Extensions toDOCSIS 3.1 have been added via updates to the DOCSIS 3.1 standard, includingFull Duplexoperation (2017), which will enable multigigabit symmetric down-stream and upstream capacity,aswell as DOCSIS LowLatency(2018) and otherfeatures to reduce latency.At the hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) layer,the network is highly dynamic, withcable network operators performing fiber node splits on a regular basis, whichpushes fiber closer to the home and reduces the number of homes served by eachnode, thereby making more capacity available for each home served. In some casesthe HFC last mile is replaced with fiber to the home, and manynew builds are fiberto the home as well.Cable Internet subscribers require a DOCSIS cable modem to serveasthe in-terface between the home network and the ISP network. Eachcable modem sendsdata on one upstream and one downstream channel.Each channel is allocatedusing FDM.DOCSIS 3.0 uses multiple channels.The usual scheme is to takeeach 6 or 8 MHz downstream channel and modulate it with QAM-64 or,ifthecable quality is exceptionally good, QAM-256; a 6-MHz channel and QAM-64yields about 36 Mbps. Accounting for signaling overhead, the net bandwidth isabout 27 Mbps. With QAM-256, the net payload is about 39 Mbps.The Europeanvalues are 1/3 larger due to the larger bandwidth available.'),\n",

Insome cases,the user’sInternet service provider (ISP) provides a single hardware device thatcombines the cable modem and wireless access point. The interface between thecable modem and the rest of the ISP network is more complicated, as it involvescoordinating resource sharing among manycable subscribers who may be con-nected to the same headend. This resource sharing technically occurs at the linklayer,not the physical layer,although we will coveritinthis chapter for the sakeofcontinuity.2.7.4 Resource Sharing in DOCSIS Networks: Nodes and MinislotsThere is one important fundamental difference between the HFC system ofFig. 2-45(a)and the telephone system of Fig.2-45(b). Inagivenresidential neigh-borhood, a single cable is shared by manyhouses, whereas in the telephone sys-tem, every house has its own private local loop. When these cables are used fortelevision broadcasting, sharing is natural. All the programs are broadcast on thecable and it does not matter whether there are 10 viewers or 10,000 viewers. Whenthe same cable is used for Internet access, however, itmatters a lot if there are 10users or 10,000. If one user decides to download a very large file or stream an 8Kmovie, that bandwidth is not available to other users. More users sharing a singlecable creates more competition for the bandwidth of the cable. The telephone sys-tem does not have this particular property: downloading a large file overanADSLline does not reduce your neighbor’sbandwidth. On the other hand, the bandwidthof coax is much higher than that of twisted pairs. In essence, the bandwidth that agivensubscriber receivesatany givenmoment depends quite a bit on the usage ofsubscribers who happen to be sharing the same cable, as we describe in more detailbelow.Cable ISPs have tackled this problem by splitting up long cables and con-necting each one directly to a fiber node. The bandwidth from the headend to eachfiber node is significant, so as long as there are not too manysubscribers on eachcable segment, the amount of trafficismanageable. A typical node size about tenor fifteen years ago was 500–2000 homes, although the number of homes per nodecontinues to decrease as buildout to the edge continues in an effort to increasespeeds to subscribers. Increases in cable Internet subscribers overthe past decade,coupled with increasing trafficdemand from subscribers, has created the need toincreasingly split these cables and add more fiber nodes. By 2019, a typical nodesize was about 300–500 homes, although in some areas, ISPs are building N+0HFC (a.k.a. ‘‘Fiber Deep’’) architectures, which can reduce this number to as lowas 70, which eliminates the need for cascading signal amplifiers and runs fiberdirect from network headends to nodes at the last segment of coaxial cable.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 198}, page_content='SEC. 2.7 CABLE NETWORKS 175When a cable modem is plugged in and powered up, it scans the downstreamchannels looking for a special packet that the headend periodically sends, provid-ing system parameters to modems that have just come online. Upon receiving thispacket, the newmodem announces its presence on one of the upstream channels.The headend responds by assigning the modem an upstream and a downstreamchannel. These assignments can be changed later if the headend deems it necessaryto balance the load.There is more RF noise in the upstream direction because the system was notoriginally designed for data, and noise from multiple subscribers is funneled to theheadend, so the modem transmits using a more conservative approach. Thisrangesfrom QPSK to QAM-128, where some of the symbols are used for error protectionwith trellis coded modulation.With fewer bits per symbol on the upstream, theasymmetry between upstream and downstream rates is much more than suggestedby Fig. 2-46.Today’sDOCSIS modems request a time to transmit, and then the CMTSgrants one or more timeslots that the modem can transmit, based on availability; si-multaneous users all contend for upstream and downstream access. The networkuses TDM to share upstream bandwidth across multiple subscribers. Time is divid-ed intominislots;each subscriber sends in a different minislot.The headend an-nounces the start of a newround of minislots periodically,but the announcementfor the start of each minislot is not heard at all modems simultaneously due to sig-nal propagation time down the cable. By knowing howfar it is from the headend,each modem can compute howlong ago the first minislot really started.It is important for the modem to knowits distance to the headend to get thetiming right.The modem first determines its distance from the headend by sendingit a special packet and seeing howlong it takes to get the response.This process iscalledranging.Each upstream packet must fit in one or more consecutive minis-lots at the headend when it is received. Minislotlength is network dependent.Atypical payload is 8 bytes.During initialization, the headend assigns each modem to a minislot to use forrequesting upstream bandwidth.When a computer wants to send a packet, it trans-fers the packet to the modem, which then requests the necessary number of minis-lots for it.If the request is accepted, the headend puts an acknowledgement on thedownstream channel telling the modem which minislots have been reserved for itspacket. Thepacket is then sent, starting in the minislot allocated to it.Additionalpackets can be requested using a field in the header.As a rule, multiple modems will be assigned the same minislot, which leads tocontention (multiple modems attempting to send upstream data at the same time).CDMA can allowmultiple subscribers to share the same minislot, although it re-duces the rate per subscriber.Another alternative istonot use CDMA, in whichcase there may be no acknowledgement to the request because of a collision. Whencollisions occur in this case, the modem just waits a random time and tries again.After each successive failure, the randomization time is doubled. (For readers'),\n",

Ethernet cannot be used on cable because stationscannot sense the medium. Wewill come back to these issues in Chap. 4.)The downstream channels are managed differently from the upstream chan-nels. For starters, there is only one sender (the headend), so there is no contentionand no need for minislots.Foranother,the amount of trafficdownstream is usuallymuch larger than upstream, so a fixed packet size of 204 bytes is used.Part of thatis a Reed-Solomon error-correcting code and some other overhead, leaving a userpayload of 184 bytes.These numbers were chosen for compatibility with digitaltelevision using MPEG-2, so the TV and downstream data channels are formattedthe same way.Logically,the connections are as depicted in Fig. 2-47.\\nFigure2-47.Typical details of the upstream and downstream channels in NorthAmerica.\\n2.8 COMMUNICATION SATELLITESIn the 1950s and early 1960s, people tried to set up communication systems bybouncing signals offmetallized weather balloons.Unfortunately,the receivedsig-nals were too weak to be of anypractical use.Then, the U.S. Navy noticed a kindof permanent weather balloon in the sky—the moon—and built an operational sys-tem for ship-to-shore communication by bouncing signals offit.Further progress in the celestial communication field had to wait until the firstcommunication satellite was launched.The key difference between an artificialsatellite and a real one is that the artificial one can amplify the signals before send-ing them back, turning a strange curiosity into a powerful communication system.Communication satellites have some interesting properties that makethemattractive for manyapplications.

Regenerating signals in this way improvesperformance compared to abent pipe because the satellite does not amplify noise in the upward signal.Thedownward beams can be broad, covering a substantial fraction of the earth’ssur-face, or narrow, covering an area only hundreds of kilometers in diameter.According to Kepler’slaw,the orbital period of a satellite varies as the radiusof the orbit to the 3/2 power.The higher the satellite, the longer the period.Nearthe surface of the earth, the period is about 90 minutes.Consequently,low-orbitsatellites pass out of viewfairly quickly (due to the satellites’ motion), so manyofthem are needed to provide continuous coverage and ground antennas must trackthem. Atan altitude of about 35,800 km, the period is 24 hours.At an altitude of384,000 km, the period is about 1 month, as anyone who has observed the moonregularly can testify.Asatellite’speriod is important, but it is not the only issue in determiningwhere to place it.Another issue is the presence of the Van Allen belts, layers ofhighly charged particles trapped by the earth’smagnetic field. Anysatellite flyingwithin them would be destroyed fairly quickly by the particles.These factors leadto three regions in which satellites can be placed safely.These regions and someof their properties are illustrated in Fig.2-48. Below, wewill briefly describe thesatellites that inhabit each of these regions.2.8.1 GeostationarySatellitesIn 1945, the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarkecalculated that a satellite atan altitude of 35,800 km in a circular equatorial orbit would appear to remainmotionless in the sky, soitwould not need to be tracked (Clarke, 1945).He wenton to describe a complete communication system that used these (manned)geosta-tionary satellites,including the orbits, solar panels, radio frequencies, and launchprocedures. Unfortunately,heconcluded that satellites were impractical due to theimpossibility of putting power-hungry,fragile vacuum tube amplifiers into orbit, sohe neverpursued this idea further,although he wrote some science fiction storiesabout it.The invention of the transistor changed all that, and the first artificial commu-nication satellite, Telstar,was launched in July 1962.Since then, communicationsatellites have become a multibillion dollar business and the only aspect of outerspace that has become highly profitable. Thesehigh-flying satellites are often call-edGEO(Geostationary Earth Orbit)satellites.With current technology,itistechnologically unwise to have geostationary sat-ellites spaced much closer than 2 degrees in the 360-degree equatorial plane, to'),\n",

However, each transponder can use multiple fre-quencies and polarizations to increase the available bandwidth.To prevent total chaos in the sky, orbit slot allocation is done by ITU.Thisprocess is highly political, with countries barely out of the stone age demanding‘‘their’’orbit slots (for the purpose of leasing them to the highest bidder).Othercountries, however, maintain that national property rights do not extend up to themoon and that no country has a legalright to the orbit slots above its territory.Toadd to the fight, commercial telecommunication is not the only application.Tele-vision broadcasters, governments, and the military also want a piece of the orbitingpie.Modern satellites can be quite large, weighing over5000 kg and consumingseveral kilowatts of electric power produced by the solar panels.The effects ofsolar,lunar,and planetary gravity tend to move them awayfrom their assignedorbit slots and orientations, an effect countered by on-board rocket motors.Thisfine-tuning activity is calledstation keeping.However, when the fuel for themotors has been exhausted (typically after about 10 years), the satellite drifts andtumbles helplessly,soithas to be turned off. Eventually,the orbit decays and thesatellite reenters the atmosphere and burns up or (very rarely) crashes to earth.Orbit slots are not the only bone of contention.Frequencies are an issue, too,because the downlink transmissions interfere with existing microwave users. Con-sequently,ITU has allocated certain frequencybands to satellite users.The mainones are listed in Fig.2-49. TheCband was the first to be made available for com-mercial satellite traffic.

Toallowtraffictogoboth ways at the same time, twochannels are re-quired. Thesechannels are already overcrowded because theyare also used by thecommon carriers for terrestrial microwave links.

Fortunately,heavy storms are usually local-ized, so using several widely separated ground stations instead of just one circum-vents the problem, but at the price of extra antennas, extra cables, and extra elec-tronics to enable rapid switching between stations.Bandwidth has also been allo-cated in the Ka (K above)band for commercial satellite traffic, but the equipmentneeded to use it is expensive.Inaddition to these commercial bands, manygov-ernment and military bands also exist.Amodern satellite has around 40 transponders, most often with a 36-MHzbandwidth. Usually,each transponder operates as a bent pipe, but recent satelliteshave some on-board processing capacity,allowing more sophisticated operation.In the earliest satellites, the division of the transponders into channels was static:the bandwidth was simply split up into fixed frequencybands. Nowadays, eachtransponder beam is divided into time slots, with various users taking turns.Onceagain, we see howTDM and FDM are used in manycontexts.The first geostationary satellites had a single spatial beam that illuminatedabout 1/3 of the earth’ssurface, called itsfootprint.With the enormous decline inthe price, size, and power requirements of microelectronics, a much more sophisti-cated broadcasting strategy has become possible.Each satellite is equipped withmultiple antennas and multiple transponders.Each downward beam can befocused on a small geographical area, so multiple upward and downward transmis-sions can takeplace simultaneously.Typically,these so-calledspot beamsareelliptically shaped, and can be as small as a fewhundred km in diameter.Acom-munication satellite for the United States typically has one wide beam for the con-tiguous 48 states, plus spot beams for Alaska and Hawaii.'),\n",

Directbroadcast satellite television uses this technology for one-waytransmission.In manyVSATsystems, the microstations do not have enough power to com-municate directly with one another (via the satellite, of course).Instead, a specialground station, thehub,with a large, high-gain antenna is needed to relay trafficbetween VSATs, as shown in Fig.2-50.

Itdoes not cost anymore to send a message to thousands of stations withinatransponder’sfootprint than it does to send to only one.Forsome applications,this property is very useful.Forexample, one could imagine a satellite broadcast-ing popular Web pages to the caches of a large number of computers spread overawide area.Even when broadcasting can be simulated with point-to-point lines, sat-ellite broadcasting may be much cheaper.Onthe other hand, from a privacy pointof view, satellites are a complete disaster: everybody can hear everything. Encryp-tion is essential for confidentiality.Satellites also have the property that the cost of transmitting a message is inde-pendent of the distance traversed. Acall across the ocean costs no more to servicethan a call across the street.Satellites also have excellent error rates and can be de-ployed almost instantly,amajor consideration for disaster response and militarycommunication.2.8.2 Medium-EarthOrbit SatellitesAt much lower altitudes, between the twoVan Allen belts, we find theMEO(Medium-Earth Orbit)satellites. Asviewed from the earth, these drift slowly inlongitude, taking something like6hours to circle the earth.Accordingly,theymust be tracked as theymove through the sky. Because theyare lower than theGEOs, theyhaveasmaller footprint on the ground and require less powerful trans-mitters to reach them.Currently,theyare used for navigation systems rather thantelecommunications, so we will not examine them further here.The constellationof roughly 30GPS(Global Positioning System)satellites orbiting at about 20,200km are examples of MEO satellites.2.8.3 Low-Earth Orbit SatellitesMoving down in altitude, we come to theLEO(Low-Earth Orbit)satellites.Due to their rapid motion, large numbers of them are needed for a complete sys-tem.

Thelaunch cost is substantially cheaper too.In this section, we will exam-ine twoexamples of satellite constellations used for voice service: Iridium andGlobalstar.Forthe first 30 years of the satellite era, low-orbit satellites were rarely usedbecause theyzip into and out of viewsoquickly.In1990, Motorola brokenewground by filing an application with the FCC asking for permission to launch 77low-orbit satellites for theIridiumproject (element 77 is iridium).The plan waslater revised to use only 66 satellites, so the project should have been renamedDysprosium (element 66), but that probably sounded too much likeadisease. Theidea was that as soon as one satellite went out of view, another would replace it.This proposal set offafeeding frenzy among other communication companies.Allof a sudden, everyone wanted to launch a chain of low-orbit satellites.After sevenyears of cobbling together partners and financing, communicationservice beganinNovember 1998.Unfortunately,the commercial demand forlarge, heavy satellite telephones was negligible because the mobile phone networkhad grown in a spectacular way since 1990.As a consequence, Iridium was notprofitable and was forced into bankruptcyinAugust 1999 in one of the most spec-tacular corporate fiascos in history.The satellites and other assets (worth $5 bil-lion) were later purchased by an investor for $25 million at a kind of extraterres-trial garage sale. Other satellite business ventures promptly followed suit.The Iridium service restarted in March 2001 and has been growing eversince.It provides voice, data, paging, fax, and navigation service everywhere on land, air,and sea, via hand-held devices that communicate directly with the Iridium satel-lites. Customersinclude the maritime, aviation, and oil exploration industries, aswell as people traveling in parts of the world lacking a telecom infrastructure (e.g.,deserts, mountains, the South Pole, and some developing countries).The Iridium satellites are positioned at an altitude of 670 km, in circular polarorbits. Theyare arranged in north-south necklaces, with one satellite every 32degrees of latitude, as shown in Fig.2-51. Eachsatellite has a maximum of 48cells (spot beams) and a capacity of 3840 channels, some of which are used forpaging and navigation, while others are used for data and voice.With six satellite necklaces, the entire earth is covered, as suggested byFig. 2-51.An interesting property of Iridium is that communication between dis-tant customers takes place in space, as shown in Fig.2-52(a). Herewe see a callerat the North Pole contacting a satellite directly overhead. Each satellite has fourneighbors with which it can communicate, twointhe same necklace (shown) andtwoinadjacent necklaces (not shown). Thesatellites relay the call across this griduntil it is finally sent down to the callee at the South Pole.An alternative design to Iridium isGlobalstar.Itisbased on 48 LEO satel-lites but uses a different switching scheme than the one used by Iridium.WhereasIridium relays calls from satellite to satellite, which requires complexswitching'),\n",

Tomakespace research more accessible, academic researchers from California PolytechnicUniversity and Stanford got together in 1999 to define a standard for miniature sat-ellites and an associated launcher that would greatly lower launch costs (Nugent etal., 2008).Thesecubesatsare satellites in units of 10 cm× 10 cm× 10 cm cubes,each weighing no more than 1 kilogram, that can be launched for a price as little as$40,000 each.The launcher flies as a secondary payload on commercial spacemissions. It is basically a tube that takes up to three units of cubesats and usessprings to release them into orbit. Roughly 20 cubesats have launched so far,withmanymore in the works. Most of them communicate with ground stations on theUHF and VHF bands.Another deployment of LEO satellites is an attempted satellite-based Internetbackbone network, OneWeb’sdeployment will initially involveaconstellation ofseveral hundred satellites.If successful, the project promises to bring high-speedInternet access to places which may not currently have it. The satellites will oper-ate in the Kuband and will use a technique called ‘‘progressive pitch,’’ wherebythe satellites are turned slightly to avoid interference with geostationary satellitesthat are transmitting in the same band.2.9 COMPARING DIFFERENT ACCESS NETWORKSLet’snow compare the properties of the different types of access networks thatwe have surveyed.2.9.1 Terrestrial Access Networks: Cable, Fiber,and ADSLCable, FTTH, and ADSL are much more similar than theyare different. Theyoffer comparable service and, as competition between them heats up, probablycomparable prices. All access network technologies, including cable, ADSL, andFiber to the Home, nowuse fiber in the backbone; theydiffer on the last-mile ac-cess technology at the physical and link layers. Fiber and ADSL providers tend todelivermore consistent bandwidth to each subscriber because each user has dedi-cated capacity.Ongoing and recent reports in the United States, such as the FCC’sMeasuring Broadband America (MBA) initiative (which is released annually),report that access ISPs typically meet their advertised rates.As an ADSL or FTTH access network acquires more users, their increasingnumbers have little effect on existing users, since each user has a dedicated con-nection all the way to the home. On the other hand, cable subscribers share the ca-pacity of a single node; as a result, when one or more users on a node increase theirusage, other users may experience congestion. Consequently,cable providers now'),\n",

With cable, as more subscribers sign up for Internet ser-vice, the performance of other users in the same node will suffer.Inresponse,cable ISPs split busy cables, connecting each one to a fiber node directly (this prac-tice is sometimes called anode split.Aspreviously discussed, the number ofhomes per node continues to steadily decrease as cable ISPs continue to build fibercloser to the edge of the network.Cable, fiber,and ADSL are available in different regions, and performance ofthese networks differs according to both the technology itself, and howeach re-spective technology is deployed. Mosthome users in developed countries can haveatelephone line if theywant it, but not all users are close enough to their end of-fices to get ADSL. Some are stuck with 56-kbps dial-up lines, especially in ruralareas. In fact, eveninthe United States, there are large areas in which a1.544-Mbps T1 line is an unobtainable luxury.InEurope, with its higher popula-tion density,500 Mbps fiber-optic Internet is common in big cities. Some evenhave 1-Gbps service available.Also, not everyone has cable.If you do have cable and the companyprovidesInternet access, you can get it; distance to the fiber node or headend is not an issue.Availability of cable and fiber in certain regions, particularly sparsely populated re-gions, remains a concern though. Ultimately,high-speed Internet access today stilldepends on the deployment of fiber or cable to homes. In the case of cable net-works, increasing node splits require the deployment of fiber further into the neigh-borhood, as opposed to relying on existing coaxial cable infrastructure.Even inthe case of ADSL, speed drops offsignificantly beyond a fewkilometers from acentral office, so evenADSL requires some kind of fiber buildout at the edge (e.g.,FTTN) to offer high speed to sparsely populated areas. All of these are expensivepropositions.Historically,the telephone infrastructure (and DSL networks) have generallybeen more reliable than cable, although data from the FCC’sMBA project showthat gap has narrowed, with most cable and DSL service achieving at least ‘‘twonines’’ofreliability (i.e., 99% uptime, or tens of hours of downtime a year). Satel-lite and metropolitan-area wireless networks perform less reliably.Bycomparison,the conventional phone network achieves‘‘fivenines’’ofreliability,which corre-sponds to only a fewminutes of unavailability each year (Bischof et al., 2018).Being a point-to-point medium, ADSL is inherently more secure than cable.Anycable user can easily read all the packets going down the cable, no matter forwhom theyare intended.Forthis reason, anydecent cable provider will encrypt all'),\n",

After all, the telephone system had changed lit-tle in the previous 100 years and showed no signs of changing in the next 100years. Thisglacial movement was caused in no small part by the regulatory envi-ronment in which the telephone companies were expected to provide good voiceservice at reasonable prices (which theydid), and in return got a guaranteed profiton their investment. For people with data to transmit, 1200-bps modems wereavailable. Thatwaspretty much all there was.The introduction of competition in telecommunications in 1984 in the UnitedStates and somewhat later in Europe radically changed this situation.Telephonecompanies beganreplacing their long-haul networks with fiber and introducedhigh-bandwidth services likeADSL. Theyalso stopped their long-time practice ofcharging artificially high prices to long-distance users to subsidize local service.All of a sudden, terrestrial fiber looked likethe winner.Nevertheless, communication satellites have some niche markets that fiber can-not address.First, when rapid deployment is critical, satellites win easily.Aquickresponse is useful for military communication systems in times of war and disasterresponse in times of peace. Following the massive December 2004 Sumatra earth-quakeand subsequent tsunami, for example, communications satellites were ableto restore communications to first responders within 24 hours.This rapid responsewaspossible because there is a developed market in which large players, such asIntelsat with over50satellites, can rent out capacity pretty much anywhere it isneeded. For customers served by existing satellite networks, a solar-poweredVSATcan be set up easily and quickly to provide a megabit/sec link.Asecond niche is for communication in places where the terrestrial infrastruc-ture is poorly developed. Manypeople nowadays want to communicate every-where theygo. Mobilephone networks coverthose locations with good populationdensity,but do not do an adequate job in other places (e.g., at sea or in the desert).Conversely,Iridium provides voice service everywhere on earth, evenatthe SouthPole. Terrestrial infrastructure can also be expensive toinstall, depending on theterrain and necessary rights of way.Indonesia, for example, has its own satellitefor domestic telephone traffic. Launchingone satellite was cheaper than stringingthousands of undersea cables among the 13,677 islands in the archipelago.Athird niche is when broadcasting is essential.Amessage sent by satellitecan be receivedbythousands of ground stations at once. Satellites are used to dis-tribute much network TV programming to local stations for this reason.There isnowalarge market for satellite broadcasts of digital TV and radio directly to end'),\n",

In2016, the FCC’sMeasuring Broadband America project reported thatthese satellite-based providers were among the fewInternet Service Providers whowere seeing decreased performance overtime, likely because of increased sub-scribership and limited bandwidth. The report found that these providers wereunable to offer speeds more than about 10 Mbps.Nonetheless, in recent years, satellite Internet access has seen growing interest,particularly in niche markets such as in-flight Internet access. Some in-flight Inter-net access involves direct communication with mobile broadband towers, but forflights overoceans, this does not work. Anothermethod that helps cope with lim-ited bandwidth on airplanesinvolves transmission of data to a collection of satel-lites in geostationary orbit. Other companies including OneWeb, as discussedabove,and Boeing are working on building a satellite-based Internet backboneusing LEO satellites. The markets will still be somewhat niche, as the throughputwill be approximately 50 Mbps, much lower than terrestrial Internet.In short, it looks likethe mainstream communication of the future will be ter-restrial fiber optics combined with cellular networks, but for some specialized uses,satellites are better.However, one caveat applies to all of this: economics.Al-though fiber offers more bandwidth, it is conceivable that terrestrial and satellitecommunication may be able to compete aggressively on price in some markets. Ifadvances in technology radically cut the cost of deploying a satellite (e.g., if somefuture space vehicle can toss out dozens of satellites on one launch) or low-orbitsatellites catch on in a big way,itisnot certain that fiber will win all markets.2.10 POLICYAT THE PHYSICAL LAYERVarious aspects of the physical layer involveregulatory and policydecisionsthat ultimately affect howthese technologies are used and developed.

Worldwide, an agencyofITU-R (WRC) tries to coordinate this allocationso devices that work in multiple countries can be manufactured. However, coun-tries are not bound by ITU-R’srecommendations, and the FCC which does the al-location for the United States, has occasionally rejected ITU-R’srecommendations(usually because theyrequired some politically powerful group to give upsomepiece of the spectrum).Even when a portion of spectrum has been allocated to a specific use, such asmobile phones, there is the additional issue of which companyisallowed to usewhich frequencies.Three algorithms were widely used in the past.The oldest al-gorithm, often called thebeauty contest,requires each carrier to explain whyitsproposal serves the public interest best.Government officials then decide which ofthe nice stories theyenjoymost. Having a government official award propertyworth billions of dollars to his favorite companyoften leads to bribery,corruption,nepotism, and worse. Furthermore,evenascrupulously honest government officialwho thought that a foreign companycould do a better job than anyofthe nationalcompanies would have a lot of explaining to do.This observation led to the second algorithm: holding alotteryamong the in-terested companies.The problem with lotteries is that companies with no interestin using the spectrum can enter the lottery.If, say,ahamburger restaurant or shoestore chain wins, it can resell the spectrum to a carrier at a huge profit and with norisk.Bestowing huge windfalls on alert but otherwise random companies has beenseverely criticized by many, which led to the third approach:auctionthe spectrumto the highest bidder.When the British government auctioned offthe frequenciesneeded for 3G mobile systems in 2000, it expected to get about $4 billion.It ac-tually receivedabout $40 billion because the carriers got into a feeding frenzy,scared to death of missing the mobile boat.This event switched on other govern-ments’ greedy bits and inspired them to hold their own auctions.It worked, but italso left some of the carriers with so much debt that theyare close to bankruptcy.Even in the best cases, it will takemanyyears to recoup these licensing fees.Acompletely different approach to allocating frequencies is to not allocatethem at all.Instead, let everyone transmit at will, but regulate the power used sothat stations have such a short range that theydonot interfere with each other.Accordingly,most governments have set aside some frequencybands, called theISM(Industrial, Scientific, Medical)bands for unlicensed usage.Garage dooropeners, cordless phones, radio-controlled toys, wireless mice, and numerous otherwireless household devices use the ISM bands.To minimize interference between'),\n",

The900-MHz band was usedfor early versions of 802.11, but it is crowded. The2.4-GHz band is available inmost countries and widely used for 802.11b/g and Bluetooth, though it is subject tointerference from microwave ovens and radar installations.The 5-GHz part of thespectrum includesU-NII(Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure)bands. The5-GHz bands are relatively undeveloped but, since theyhavethe mostbandwidth and are used by WiFi specifications such as 802.11ac, theyhavebe-come massively popular and crowded, as well.26MHz\\n902MHz928MHz2.4GHz5.25GHz5.35GHz5.47GHz5.725GHzU-NII bands5.825GHz2.4835GHz\\nISM band83.5MHz100MHz255MHzISM band 100MHzISM band\\nFigure2-53.ISM and U-NII bands used in the United States by wireless devices.The unlicensed bands have been a roaring success overthe past several dec-ades.

Even some ISPs are nowgetting intothe game with technologies such as LTE-U, which involves a deployment of anLTEcellular network in the unlicensed spectrum. Such technology could allowmobile devices to operate in this unlicensed spectrum, in addition to the portions ofspectrum that are explicitly allocated to operating cellular networks. LTE-U mightallowfixed-line ISPs who are deploying WiFi access points in hundreds of mil-lions of homes to turn their network of access points into a network of cellular basestations. Of course, allowing cellular phones to use the unlicensed spectrum comeswith its own set of complications. For example, devices that operate in the unli-censed spectrum must respect other devices that are using the same spectrum and'),\n",

LTE-U may also faceits own reliability and performance challenges as it must back offtointeract nicelywith other devices that use the unlicensed spectrum, from other WiFi devices tobaby monitors.Various developments in policyoverthe past 10 years continue to enable moreinnovation in wireless technologies.One development in the United States is thepotential future allocation of more unlicensed spectrum.In 2009, the FCC decidedto allowunlicensed use ofwhite spacesaround 700 MHz.White spaces are fre-quencybands that have been allocated but are not being used locally.The transitionfrom analog to all-digital television broadcasts in the United States in 2010 freedup white spaces around 700 MHz.One challenge is that to use the white spaces,unlicensed devices must be able to detect anynearby licensed transmitters, includ-ing wireless microphones, that have first rights to use the frequencyband. TheFCC also opened 57 GHz to 64 GHz for unlicensed operation in 2001. This rangeis an enormous portion of spectrum, more than all the other ISM bands combined,so it can support the kind of high-speed networks that would be needed to streamhigh-definition TV through the air across your living room. At 60 GHz, radiowavesare absorbed by oxygen.This means that signals do not propagate far,mak-ing them well suited to short-range networks. The high frequencies (60 GHz is inthe Extremely High Frequencyor‘‘millimeter’’band, just belowinfrared radiation)posed an initial challenge for equipment makers, but products are nowonthe mar-ket.In the United States, other spectrum bands are also being repurposed and auc-tioned offtocarriers, including 2.5 and 2.9 GHz, the C-Band (previously used forsatellite communications) in the 3.7–4.2 GHz range, as well as others, including3.5, 6, 24, 28, 37, and 49 GHz.The FCC is also considering the use of certain veryhigh bands for short-range communication, such as the 95 GHz range. In late 2018,the FCC launched its first 5G auction, with more auctions are planned for futureyears. Theseauctions will open up a significant amount of spectrum to for mobilebroadband, enabling the higher bandwidths that would be required for streamingvideo and Internet of Things applications.The 24 and 28 GHz spectrum each haveapproximately 3,000 licenses up for sale. The FCC is also giving discounts tosmall business and rural providers. Auctionsfor pieces of the 37, 39, and 49 GHzspectrum bands are scheduled as well. In other countries, some of these spectrumbands may operate as unlicensed spectrum.Forexample, the automotive industryin Germanysuccessfully lobbied to allowthe 3.5 GHz band for private enterpriseuse; other European countries are likely to followsuit.2.10.2 TheCellular NetworkIt is interesting howpolitical and tinymarketing decisions can have a hugeimpact on the deployment of cellular networks in the United States and Europe.The first mobile system was devised in the U.S. by AT&T and later mandated for'),\n",

Incontrast, when mobile phones came to Europe, every country devised its own sys-tem, which resulted in a fiasco.Europe learned from its mistakeand when digital came around, the govern-ment-run PTTs got together and standardized on a single system (GSM), so anyEuropean mobile phone would work anywhere in Europe.By then, the U.S. haddecided that government should not be in the standardization business, so it leftdigital to the marketplace. Thisdecision resulted in different equipment manufact-urers producing different kinds of mobile phones.As a consequence, in the U.S.twomajor—and completely incompatible—digital mobile phone systems were de-ployed, as well as other minor systems.Despite an initial lead by the U.S., mobile phone ownership and usage inEurope is nowfar greater than in the U.S.Having a single system that works any-where in Europe and with anyprovider is part of the reason, but there is more.Asecond area where the U.S. and Europe differed is in the humble matter of phonenumbers. Inthe U.S., mobile phones are mixed in with regular (fixed) telephones.Thus, there is no way for a caller to see if, say,(212) 234-5678 is a fixed telephone(cheap or free call) or a mobile phone (expensive call). Tokeep people from get-ting nervous about placing calls, the telephone companies decided to makethemobile phone owner pay for incoming calls.As a consequence, manypeople hesi-tated buying a mobile phone for fear of running up a big bill by just receiving calls.In Europe, mobile phone numbers have a special area code (analogous to 800 and900 numbers) so theyare instantly recognizable.Consequently,the usual rule of‘‘caller pays’’also applies to mobile phones in Europe (except for internationalcalls, where costs are split).Athird issue that has had a large impact on adoption is the widespread use ofprepaid mobile phones in Europe (up to 75% in some areas), which can be pur-chased in manystores, and evenonline. Thesecards are preloaded with a balanceof, for example, 20 or 50 euros and can be recharged (using a secret PIN code)when the balance drops to zero.As a consequence, practically every teenager andmanysmall children in Europe have (usually prepaid) mobile phones so their par-ents can locate them, without the danger of the child running up a huge bill.If themobile phone is used only occasionally,its use is essentially free since there is nomonthly charge or charge for incoming calls.The auctioning of coveted spectrum bands for 5G, coupled with manytech-nological advances previously discussed in this chapter,ispoised to shakeupthecellular network edge in the next several years. Already,weare seeing the rise ofMVNOs(Mobile Virtual Network Operators)which are wireless carriers whichdo not own the network infrastructure overwhich theyprovide service to their cus-tomers. Ascell sizes continue to shrink with higher frequencies and hardware forsmall cells continues to be commoditized, MVNOs pay to share capacity on aninfrastructure that is operated by another carrier.Theyhavethe choice whether to'),\n",

Industry is also beginning to move towards infrastruc-ture with ‘‘whitebox’’eNodeBs that connect to a central office that has virtual EPCservices; the Open Networking Foundation’sM-CORD project has implementedsuch an architecture.2.10.3 TheTelephone NetworkFordecades prior to 1984, the Bell System provided both local and long-dis-tance service throughout most of the United States.In the 1970s, the U.S. federalgovernment came to believe that this was an illegalmonopoly and sued to break itup. Thegovernment won, and on January 1, 1984, AT&T was broken up intoAT&T Long Lines, 23BOCs(Bell Operating Companies), and a fewotherpieces. The23 BOCs were grouped into sevenregional BOCs (RBOCs) to makethem economically viable.The entire nature of telecommunication in the UnitedStates was changed overnight by court order (notby an act of Congress).The exact specifications of the divestiture were described in the so-calledMFJ(Modification of Final Judgment), an oxymoron if everthere was one.Thisevent led to increased competition, better service, and lower long-distance rates forconsumers and businesses. However, prices for local service rose as the cross sub-sidies from long-distance calling were eliminated and local service had to becomeself supporting.Manyother countries have now introduced competition along sim-ilar lines.Of direct relevance to our studies is that the brand newcompetitive frameworkcaused a key technical feature to be added to the architecture of the telephone net-work. Tomakeitclear who could do what, the United States was divided up into164LATAs(Local Access and Transport Areas). Very roughly,aLAT Ais aboutas big as the area covered by one area code.Within each LATA,there was oneLEC(Local Exchange Carrier)with a monopoly on traditional telephone servicewithin its area.The most important LECs were the BOCs, although some LATAscontained one or more of the 1500 independent telephone companies operating asLECs.The newfeature was that all inter-LATA trafficwas handled by a different kindof company, anIXC(IntereXchange Carrier). Originally,AT&T Long Lineswasthe only serious IXC, but nowthere are well-established competitors such asVerizon and Sprint in the IXC business. Oneof the concerns at the breakup was toensure that all the IXCs would be treated equally in terms of line quality,tariffs,and the number of digits their customers would have todial to use them.The waythis is handled is illustrated in Fig.2-54.

Eachhexagon belongs to the IXC whose number is in it.AnyIXC that wishes to handle calls originating in a LATA can build a switch-ing office called aPOP(Point of Presence)there. TheLEC is required to connecteach IXC to every end office, either directly,asinLAT As1and 3, or indirectly,asin LATA 2.Furthermore, the terms of the connection, both technical and financial,must be identical for all IXCs.This requirement enables, a subscriber in, say,LATA 1,tochoose which IXC to use for calling subscribers in LATA 3.As part of the MFJ, the IXCs were forbidden to offer local telephone serviceand the LECs were forbidden to offer inter-LATA telephone service, although bothwere free to enter anyother business, such as operating fried chicken restaurants.In 1984, that was a fairly unambiguous statement.Unfortunately,technology has afunnyway of making the lawobsolete. Neithercable television nor mobile phoneswere covered by the agreement.As cable television went from one way to twowayand mobile phones exploded in popularity,both LECs and IXCs beganbuyingup or merging with cable and mobile operators.By 1995, Congress sawthat trying to maintain a distinction between the vari-ous kinds of companies was no longer tenable and drafted a bill to preserveac-cessibility for competition but allowcable TV companies, local telephone com-panies, long-distance carriers, and mobile operators to enter one another’sbusi-nesses.

Two recent developments, however, involvepolicyactivitysurrounding the insecurities of a signaling protocol calledSS7(Signaling System7), which is the protocol that allows cellular networks to talk to one another.Theprotocol is insecure, and Congress has asked the FCC to takeaction to addresssome of these insecurities. Another interesting development related to the 1996Telecommunications Act is howtextmessages are classified; unlikevoice trafficoverthe telephone network, which is classified as a communications service (likephone calls), SMS messages (‘‘text messages’’) are classified as an informationservice (akin to instant messages or other Internet communications services),which subjects them to very different sets of regulations concerning everythingfrom howtheycan be billed to the privacy rules that govern these messages.2.11 SUMMARYThe physical layer is the basis of all networks. Natureimposes twofundamen-tal limits on all channels, and these determine their bandwidth.These limits arethe Nyquist limit, which deals with noiseless channels, and the Shannon limit,which deals with noisy channels.Transmission media can be guided or unguided.The principal guided mediaare twisted pair,coaxial cable, and fiber optics.Unguided media include terrestrialradio, microwaves, infrared, lasers through the air,and satellites.Digital modulation methods send bits overguided and unguided media as ana-log signals. Line codes operate at baseband, and signals can be placed in a pass-band by modulating the amplitude, frequency, and phase of a carrier.Channels canbe shared between users with time, frequency, and code division multiplexing.'),\n",

Thisfarexceeds the rates of telephone modems.PONs bring fiber to the homefor evengreater access rates than ADSL.Trunks carry digital information. Theyare multiplexedwith WDM to provision manyhigh capacity links overindividualfibers, as well as with TDM to share each high rate link between users.Both cir-cuit switching and packet switching play a role.Another system for network access is the cable infrastructure, which has grad-ually evolved from coaxial cable to hybrid fiber coax, where manycable Internetservice providers nowoffer subscribers up to 1 Gbps (and, within a fewyears, like-ly 10 Gbps). The architecture of these networks is quite different, however, inthatthe capacity of the network is shared among subscribers in the same service node.Formobile devices applications, the fixed telephone system is not suitable.Mobile phones are currently in widespread use for voice and data; since 4G, allvoice is, in fact, carried overapacket-switched network. Thefirst generation, 1G,wasanalog and dominated by AMPS.2G was digital, with GSM presently themost widely deployed mobile phone system in the world. 3Gis digital and basedon broadband CDMA. 4G’smain innovation was to shift to a packet-switched core.5G is defined by smaller cell sizes, massive MIMO, and the use of significantlymore spectrum.Manyaspects of the physical layer are ultimately determined not only by thetechnologies themselves, but also by policyorganizations, such as standards bodiesand regulatory agencies. One area of the physical layer that is fairly dynamic in thepolicyarena is wireless spectrum, much of which is highly regulated. As the needfor more bandwidth for data communications grows, regulatory agencies are ac-tively searching for ways to use existing spectrum more efficiently,such as re-appropriating and auctioning portions of previously allocated spectrum.\\nPROBLEMS1.Is an oil pipeline a simplexsystem, a half-duplexsystem, a full-duplexsystem, or noneof the above?What about a riverorawalkie-talkie-style communication?2.What are the advantages of fiber optics overcopper as a transmission medium?

Theessential property of a channel that makes it ‘‘wire-like’’isthat thebits are delivered in exactly the same order in which theyare sent.At first you might think this problem is so trivial that there is nothing tostudy—machineAjust puts the bits on the wire, and machineBjust takes them off.Unfortunately,communication channels makeerrors occasionally.Furthermore,theyhaveonly a finite data rate, and there is a nonzero propagation delay betweenthe time a bit is sent and the time it is received. Theselimitations have importantimplications for the efficiencyofthe data transfer.The protocols used for commu-nications must takeall of these factors into consideration.These protocols are thesubject of this chapter.After an introduction to the key design issues present in the data link layer,wewill start our study of its protocols by looking at the nature of errors and howtheycan be detected and corrected.Then we will study a series of increasingly com-plexexample protocols, each one solving more and more of the problems presentin this layer.Finally,wewill conclude with some examples of data link protocols.201'),\n",

Ifaframe is lost due to noise on the line, no attempt is made todetect the loss or recoverfrom it in the data link layer.This class of service is ap-propriate when the error rate is very low, sorecovery is left to higher layers.It isalso appropriate for real-time traffic, such as voice or video, in which late data areworse than bad data.The next step up in terms of reliability is acknowledged connectionless service.When this service is offered, there are still no logical connections used, but eachframe sent is individually acknowledged. Inthis way,the sender knows whether aframe has arrivedcorrectly or been lost.If it has not arrivedwithin a specifiedtime interval, it can be sent again. Thisservice is useful overunreliable channels,such as wireless systems.802.11 (WiFi) is a good example of this type of linklayer service.It is perhaps worth emphasizing that providing acknowledgements in the datalink layer is just an optimization. It is neverarequirement. Thenetwork layer canalways send a packet and wait for it to be acknowledged by its peer on the remotemachine. Ifthe acknowledgement is not receivedbefore a retransmission timer ex-pires, the sender can just send the entire message again. Thetrouble with thisstrategy is that it can be inefficient. Linksfrequently have a strict maximum framelength imposed by the hardware, and known propagation delays.The networklayer does not knowthese parameters.It might send a large packet that is brokenup into, say,ten frames, of which twoare lost on average. It would then takeaverylong time for the packet to get through.Instead, if individual frames are acknow-ledged and retransmitted, then errors can be corrected more directly and morequickly.Onreliable channels, such as fiber,the overhead of a heavyweight datalink layer protocol may be unnecessary,but on (inherently unreliable) wirelesschannels the overhead is often worth the cost.Getting back to our services, the most sophisticated service the data link layercan provide to the network layer is connection-oriented service.With this service,the source and destination machines establish a connection before anydata aretransferred. Eachframe sent overthe connection is numbered, and the data linklayer guarantees that each frame sent is indeed received. Furthermore,it guaran-tees that each frame is receivedexactly once and that all frames are receivedintheright order.Connection-oriented service thus provides the network layer processeswith the equivalent of a reliable bit stream.It is appropriate overlong, unreliablelinks such as a satellite channel or a long-distance telephone circuit.If acknow-ledged connectionless service were used, it is conceivable that lost acknowledge-ments could cause a frame to be sent and receivedseveral times, wasting band-width.When connection-oriented service is used, transfers go through three distinctphases. Inthe first phase, the connection is established by having both sides ini-tialize variables and counters needed to keep track of which frames have been'),\n",

Inthe second phase, one or more frames are ac-tually transmitted.In the third and final phase, the connection is released, freeingup the variables, buffers, and other resources used to maintain the connection.3.1.2 FramingTo provide service to the network layer,the data link layer must use the serviceprovided to it by the physical layer.The physical layer accepts a rawbit streamand attempts to deliverittothe destination.If the channel is noisy,asitisfor mostwireless and some wired links, the physical layer will add some redundancytoitssignals to reduce the bit error rate to a tolerable level. However, the bit stream re-ceivedbythe data link layer is not guaranteed to be error-free. Somebits mayhave different values, and the number of bits receivedmay be less than, equal to, ormore than the number of bits transmitted.It is up to the data link layer to detectand, if necessary,correct errors.The usual approach is for the data link layer to break up the bit stream into dis-crete frames, compute a short token called a checksum for each frame, and includethe checksum in the frame when it is transmitted.(Checksum algorithms will bediscussed later in this chapter.) Whenaframe arrivesatthe destination, the re-ceiverrecomputes the checksum based on the receivedframe. Ifthe newly com-puted checksum is different from the one contained in the frame, the data link layerknows that an error has occurred and takes steps to deal with it (e.g., discarding thebad frame and possibly also sending back an error report).Breaking up the bit stream into frames is more difficult than it at first appears.Agood design must makeiteasy for a receivertofind the start of newframeswhile using little of the channel bandwidth.We will look at four methods:1. Bytecount.2. Flagbytes with byte stuffing.3. Flagbits with bit stuffing.4. Physical layer coding violations.The first framing method uses a field in the header to specify the number ofbytes in the frame.When the data link layer at the destination sees the byte count,it knows howmanybytes followand hence where the end of the frame is.Thistechnique is shown in Fig.3-3(a) for four small example frames of sizes 5, 5, 8,and 8 bytes, respectively.The trouble with this algorithm is that the count can be garbled by a transmis-sion error.For example, if the byte count of 5 in the second frame of Fig.3-3(b)becomes a 7 due to a single bit flip, the destination will get out of synchronization.It will then be unable to locate the correct start of the next frame.Even if thechecksum is incorrect so the destination knows that the frame is bad, it still has no'),\n",

(b) With one error.wayoftelling where the next frame starts.Sending a frame back to the source ask-ing for a retransmission does not help either,since the destination does not knowhowmanybytes to skip overtoget to the start of the retransmission.Forthis rea-son, the byte count method is rarely used by itself.The second framing method gets around the problem of resynchronizationafter an error by having each frame start and end with special bytes.Often thesame byte, called aflag byte,isused as both the starting and ending delimiter.This byte is shown in Fig.3-4(a) as FLAG. Two consecutive flag bytes indicatethe end of one frame and the start of the next. Thus,if the receivereverloses syn-chronization, it can just search for twoflag bytes to find the end of the currentframe and the start of the next frame.However, there is a still a problem left.It may happen that the flag byte occursin the data, especially when binary data such as photos or songs are being trans-mitted. Thissituation would interfere with the framing.One way to solvethisproblem is to have the sender’sdata link layer insert a special escape byte (ESC)just before each ‘‘accidental’’flag byte in the data.Thus, a framing flag byte canbe distinguished from one in the data by the absence or presence of an escape bytebefore it.The data link layer on the receiving end removesthe escape bytes beforegiving the data to the network layer.This technique is calledbyte stuffing.Of course, the next question is: what happens if an escape byte occurs in themiddle of the data?The answer is that it, too, is stuffed with an escape byte.Atthe receiver, the first escape byte is removed, leaving the data byte that follows it(which might be another escape byte or the flag byte).Some examples are shownin Fig.3-4(b). Inall cases, the byte sequence delivered after destuffing is exactlythe same as the original byte sequence.We can still search for a frame boundaryby looking for twoflag bytes in a row, without bothering to undo escapes.'),\n",

Framing can be alsobe done at the bit level, so frames can contain an arbitrary number of bits made upof units of anysize. Itwasdeveloped for the once-popularHDLC(High-levelData Link Control)protocol. Eachframe begins and ends with a special bit pat-tern, 01111110 or 0x7E in hexadecimal. Thispattern is a flag byte.Wheneverthesender’sdata link layer encounters fiveconsecutive 1sinthe data, it automaticallystuffs a 0 bit into the outgoing bit stream.Thisbit stuffingis analogous to bytestuffing, in which an escape byte is stuffed into the outgoing character stream be-fore a flag byte in the data. It also ensures a minimum density of transitions thathelp the physical layer maintain synchronization.USB (Universal Serial Bus) usesbit stuffing for this reason.When the receiversees fiveconsecutive incoming 1 bits, followed by a 0 bit, itautomatically destuffs (i.e., deletes) the 0 bit.Just as byte stuffing is completelytransparent to the network layer in both computers, so is bit stuffing. Ifthe userdata contain the flag pattern, 01111110, this flag is transmitted as 011111010 butstored in the receiver’smemory as 01111110.The upper layers are completelyunaware that bit stuffing is being used.Figure 3-5 givesanexample of bit stuffing.'),\n",

(a)The original data.(b) Thedata as theyappear onthe line.(c) Thedata as theyare stored in the receiver’smemory after destuffing.With bit stuffing, the boundary between twoframes can be unambiguously rec-ognized by the flag pattern.Thus, if the receiverloses track of where it is, all it hasto do is scan the input for flag sequences, since theycan only occur at frameboundaries and neverwithin the data.With both bit and byte stuffing, a side effect is that the length of a frame nowdepends on the contents of the data it carries.Forinstance, if there are no flagbytes in the data, 100 bytes might be carried in a frame of roughly 100 bytes. If,however, the data consists solely of flag bytes, each flag byte will be escaped andthe frame will become roughly 200 bytes long.With bit stuffing, the increasewould be roughly 12.5% as 1 bit is added to every byte.The last method of framing is to use a shortcut from the physical layer.WesawinChap. 2 that the encoding of bits as signals often includes redundancytohelp the receiver. This redundancymeans that some signals will not occur in regu-lar data. For example, in the 4B/5B line code 4 data bits are mapped to 5 signal bitsto ensure sufficient bit transitions.This means that 16 out of the 32 signal possibil-ities are not used. Wecan use some reserved signals to indicate the start and end offrames. Ineffect, we are using ‘‘coding violations’’(invalid characters) to delimitframes. Thebeauty of this scheme is that because theyare reserved signals, it iseasy to find the start and end of frames and there is no need to stuffthe data.Manydata link protocols use a combination of these methods for safety.Acommon pattern used for Ethernet and 802.11 is to have a frame begin with awell-defined pattern called apreamble.This pattern might be quite long (72 bitsis typical for 802.11) to allowthe receivertoprepare for an incoming packet. Thepreamble is then followed by a length (i.e., count) field in the header that is used tolocate the end of the frame.3.1.3 Error ControlHaving solved the problem of marking the start and end of each frame, wecome to the next problem: howtomakesure all frames are eventually delivered tothe network layer at the destination and in the proper order.Assume for themoment that the receivercan tell whether a frame that it receivescontains correct'),\n",

Inthis case, the re-ceiverwill not react at all, since it has no reason to react.Similarly,ifthe acknowl-edgement frame is lost, the sender will not knowhow toproceed. Itshould beclear that a protocol in which the sender transmits a frame and then waits for an ac-knowledgement, positive ornegative,will hang foreverifaframe is everlost dueto, for example, malfunctioning hardware or a faulty communication channel.This possibility is dealt with by introducing timers into the data link layer.When the sender transmits a frame, it generally also starts a timer.The timer is setto expire after an interval long enough for the frame to reach the destination, beprocessed there, and have the acknowledgement propagate back to the sender.Normally,the frame will be correctly receivedand the acknowledgement will getback before the timer runs out, in which case the timer will be canceled.However, ifeither the original frame or the acknowledgement is lost, the timerwill go off, alerting the sender to a potential problem.The obvious solution is tojust transmit the frame again. However, when frames may be transmitted multipletimes there is a danger that the receiverwill accept the same frame twoormoretimes and pass it to the network layer more than once.To prevent this from hap-pening, it is necessary to assign sequence numbers to outgoing frames, so that thereceivercan distinguish retransmissions from originals.The whole issue of managing the timers and sequence numbers so as to ensurethat each frame is ultimately passed to the network layer at the destination exactlyonce, no more and no less, is an important part of the duties of the data link layer(and higher layers).Later in this chapter,wewill look at a series of increasinglysophisticated examples to see howthis management is done.3.1.4 FlowControlAnother important design issue that occurs in the data link layer (and higherlayers as well) is what to do with a sender that systematically wants to transmitframes faster than the receivercan accept them.This situation can occur when the'),\n",

Even if thetransmission is error free, the receivermay be unable to handle the frames as fastas theyarrive and will lose some.Clearly,something has to be done to prevent this situation.Twoapproachesare commonly used.In the first one,feedback-based flowcontrol,the receiversends back information to the sender giving it permission to send more data, or atleast telling the sender howthe receiverisdoing. Inthe second one,rate-basedflowcontrol,the protocol has a built-in mechanism that limits the rate at whichsenders may transmit data, without using feedback from the receiver.In this chapter,wewill study feedback-based flowcontrol schemes, primarilybecause rate-based schemes are only seen as part of the transport layer (Chap. 5).Feedback-based schemes are seen at both the link layer and higher layers.The lat-ter is more common these days, in which case the link layer hardware is designedto run fast enough that it does not cause loss.Forexample, hardware imple-mentations of the link layer asNICs(Network Interface Cards)are sometimessaid to run at ‘‘wire speed,’’ meaning that theycan handle frames as fast as theycan arrive onthe link. Anyoverruns are then not a link problem, so theyare hand-led by higher layers.Various feedback-based flowcontrol schemes exist, but most of them use thesame basic principle.The protocol contains well-defined rules about when a send-er may transmit the next frame.These rules often prohibit frames from being sentuntil the receiverhas granted permission, either implicitly or explicitly.For ex-ample, when a connection is set up the receivermight say: ‘‘You may send menframes now, but after theyhavebeen sent, do not send anymore until I have toldyou to continue.’’ Wewill examine the details shortly.3.2 ERROR DETECTION AND CORRECTIONWe saw inChap. 2 that communication channels have a range of charac-teristics. Somechannels, likeoptical fiber in telecommunications networks, havetinyerror rates so that transmission errors are a rare occurrence. But other chan-nels, especially wireless links and aging local loops, have error rates that are ordersof magnitude larger.For these links, transmission errors are the norm. Theycannotbe avoided at a reasonable expense or cost in terms of performance.The conclu-sion is that transmission errors are here to stay.Wehaveto learn howtodeal withthem.Network designers have developed twobasic strategies for dealing with errors.Both add redundant information to the data that is sent.One strategy is to includeenough redundant information to enable the receivertobeable to deduce what the'),\n",

Theother is to include only enough redundancyto allowthe receivertodeduce that an error has occurred (but not which error) andhave itrequest a retransmission.The former strategy useserror-correcting codesand the latter useserror-detecting codes.The use of error-correcting codes isoften referred to asFEC(Forward Error Correction).Each of these techniques occupies a different ecological niche.On channelsthat are highly reliable, such as fiber,itischeaper to use an error-detecting codeand just retransmit the occasional block found to be faulty.However, onchannelssuch as wireless links that makemanyerrors, it is better to add redundancytoeachblock so that the receiverisable to figure out what the originally transmitted blockwas. FECis used on noisy channels because retransmissions are just as likely tobe in error as the first transmission.Akey consideration for these codes is the type of errors that are likely to occur.Neither error-correcting codes nor error-detecting codes can handle all possible er-rors since the redundant bits that offer protection are as likely to be receivedinerror as the data bits (which can compromise their protection).It would be nice ifthe channel treated redundant bits differently than data bits, but it does not.Theyare all just bits to the channel.This means that to avoid undetected errors the codemust be strong enough to handle the expected errors.One model is that errors are caused by extreme values of thermal noise thatoverwhelm the signal briefly and occasionally,giving rise to isolated single-bit er-rors. Anothermodel is that errors tend to come in bursts rather than singly.Thismodel follows from the physical processes that generate them—such as a deepfade on a wireless channel or transient electrical interference on a wired channel.Both models matter in practice, and theyhavedifferent trade-offs. Having theerrors come in bursts has both advantages and disadvantages overisolated sin-gle-bit errors.On the advantage side, computer data are always sent in blocks ofbits. Supposethat the block size was 1000 bits and the error rate was 0.001 per bit.If errors were independent, most blocks would contain an error.Ifthe errors camein bursts of 100, however, only one block in 100 would be affected, on average.The disadvantage of burst errors is that when theydooccur theyare much harderto correct than isolated errors.Other types of errors also exist. Sometimes,the location of an error will beknown, perhaps because the physical layer receivedananalog signal that was farfrom the expected value for a 0 or 1 and declared the bit to be lost. This situation iscalled anerasurechannel.Itiseasier to correct errors in erasure channels than inchannels that flip bits because evenifthe value of the bit has been lost, at least weknowwhich bit is in error.However, weoften do not have the benefit of erasures.We will examine both error-correcting codes and error-detecting codes next.Please keep twopoints in mind, though.First, we coverthese codes in the linklayer because this is the first place that we have run up against the problem of reli-ably transmitting groups of bits. However, the codes are widely used becausereliability is an overall concern.Error-correcting codes are also often seen in the'),\n",

Error-detecting codes are commonlyused in link, network, and transport layers.The second point to bear in mind is that error codes are applied mathematics.Unless you are particularly adept at Galois fields or the properties of sparse matri-ces, you should get codes with good properties from a reliable source rather thanmaking up your own. Infact, this is what manyprotocol standards do, with thesame codes coming up again and again. Inthe material below, wewill study asimple code in detail and then briefly describe advanced codes.In this way,wecan understand the trade-offs from the simple code and talk about the codes thatare used in practice via the advanced codes.3.2.1 Error-Correcting CodesWe will examine four different error-correcting codes:1. Hammingcodes.2. Binaryconvolutional codes.3. Reed-Solomoncodes.4. Low-Density Parity Check codes.All of these codes add redundancytothe information that is sent.Aframe consistsofmdata (i.e., message) bits andrredundant (i.e., check) bits.In ablock code,thercheck bits are computed solely as a function of themdata bits with whichtheyare associated, as though thembits were looked up in a large table to findtheir correspondingrcheck bits.In asystematic code,themdata bits are sent di-rectly,along with the check bits, rather than being encoded themselves before theyare sent.In alinear code,thercheck bits are computed as a linear function of themdata bits.Exclusive OR(XOR) or modulo 2 addition is a popular choice.Thismeans that encoding can be done with operations such as matrix multiplications orsimple logic circuits.The codes we will look at in this section are linear,sys-tematic block codes unless otherwise noted.Let the total length of a block ben(i.e.,n= m+ r). Wewill describe this asan (n,m)code. Ann-bit unit containing data and check bits is referred to as ann-bitcodeword.Thecode rate,orsimply rate, is the fraction of the codeword thatcarries information that is not redundant, orm/n.The rates used in practice varywidely.Theymight be 1/2 for a noisy channel, in which case half of the receivedinformation is redundant, or close to 1 for a high-quality channel, with only a smallnumber of check bits added to a large message.To understand howerrors can be handled, it is necessary to first look closely atwhat an error really is.Givenany two codewords that may be transmitted or re-ceived—say,10001001 and 10110001—it is possible to determine howmany'),\n",

Itis the sparse-ness with which the message is embedded in the space of codewords that allowsthe receivertodetect and correct errors.The error-detecting and error-correcting properties of a block code depend onits Hamming distance.To reliably detectderrors, you need a distanced+ 1codebecause with such a code there is no way thatdsingle-bit errors can change a validcodeword into another valid codeword. Whenthe receiversees an illegalcode-word, it can tell that a transmission error has occurred.Similarly,tocorrectder-rors, you need a distance 2d+ 1code because that way the legalcodewords are sofarapart that evenwithdchanges the original codeword is still closer than anyother codeword. Thismeans the original codeword can be uniquely determinedbased on the assumption that a larger number of errors are less likely.As a simple example of an error-correcting code, consider a code with onlyfour valid codewords:0000000000, 0000011111, 1111100000, and1111111111This code has a distance of 5, which means that it can correct double errors ordetect quadruple errors.If the codeword 0000000111 arrivesand we expect onlysingle- or double-bit errors, the receiverwill knowthat the original must have been0000011111. If,however, a triple error changes 0000000000 into 0000000111, theerror will not be corrected properly.Alternatively,ifweexpect all of these errors,we can detect them. None of the receivedcodewords are legalcodewords so anerror must have occurred. Itshould be apparent that in this example we cannotboth correct double errors and detect quadruple errors because this would requireus to interpret a receivedcodeword in twodifferent ways.'),\n",

Eachcheck bit forces themodulo 2 sum, or parity,ofsome collection of bits, including itself, to be even(orodd). Abit may be included in several check bit computations.To see whichcheck bits the data bit in positionkcontributes to, rewritekas a sum of powers of2. For example, 11 = 1 + 2 + 8 and 29 = 1 + 4 + 8 + 16.Abit is checked by justthose check bits occurring in its expansion (e.g., bit 11 is checked by bits 1, 2, and8).

Whenacodeword arrives, the receiverredoes the check bit computationsincluding the values of the receivedcheck bits. Wecall these the check results.Ifthe check bits are correct then, for evenparity sums, each check result should bezero. Inthis case, the codeword is accepted as valid.If the check results are not all zero, however, anerror has been detected. Theset of check results forms theerror syndromethat is used to pinpoint and correctthe error.InFig. 3-6,asingle-bit error occurred on the channel so the check resultsare 0, 1, 0, and 1 fork=8,4,2,and 1, respectively.This givesasyndrome of0101 or 4+ 1= 5. Bythe design of the scheme, this means that the fifth bit is inerror.Flipping the incorrect bit (which might be a check bit or a data bit) and dis-carding the check bits givesthe correct message of an ASCII ‘‘A.’’Hamming distances are valuable for understanding block codes, and Hammingcodes are used in error-correcting memory.However, most networks use strongercodes. The second code we will look at is aconvolutional code.This code is theonly one we will coverthat is not a block code.In a convolutional code, an encod-er processes a sequence of input bits and generates a sequence of output bits. Thereis no natural message size or encoding boundary as in a block code.The outputdepends on the current and previous input bits. That is, the encoder has memory.The number of previous bits on which the output depends is called theconstraintlengthof the code. Convolutional codes are specified in terms of their rate andconstraint length.Convolutional codes are widely used in deployed networks, for example, aspart of the GSM mobile phone system, in satellite communications, and in 802.11.As an example, a popular convolutional code is shown in Fig.3-7. Thiscode isknown as the NASA convolutional code ofr= 1/2 andk= 7, since it was firstused for theVoyagerspace missions starting in 1977. Since then it has been liber-ally reused, for example, as part of 802.11.\\nInputbit\\nOutputbit 1 S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6\\nOutputbit 2 Figure3-7.The NASA binary convolutional code used in 802.11.In Fig.3-7, each input bit on the left-hand side produces twooutput bits on theright-hand side that are XOR sums of the input and internal state.

Each time another bit isinput the values in the registers are shifted to the right. For example, if 111 is inputand the initial state is all zeros, the internal state, written left to right, will become100000, 110000, and 111000 after the first, second, and third bits have been input.The output bits will be 11, followed by 10, and then 01.It takes sevenshifts toflush an input completely so that it does not affect the output. The constraint lengthof this code is thusk= 7.Aconvolutional code is decoded by finding the sequence of input bits that ismost likely to have produced the observed sequence of output bits (which includesanyerrors). For small values ofk,this is done with a widely used algorithm devel-oped by Viterbi (Forney, 1973). Thealgorithm walks the observed sequence, keep-ing for each step and for each possible internal state the input sequence that wouldhave produced the observed sequence with the fewest errors. The input sequencerequiring the fewest errors at the end is the most likely message.Convolutional codes have been popular in practice because it is easy to factorthe uncertainty of a bit being a 0 or a 1 into the decoding. For example, suppose< 1V is the logical 0 leveland +1V is the logical 1 level, we might receive 0.9V and< 0.1V for 2 bits.Instead of mapping these signals to 1 and 0 right away, wewouldliketotreat 0.9V as ‘‘very likely a 1’’and< 0.1V as ‘‘maybe a 0’’and correct thesequence as a whole. Extensions of the Viterbi algorithm can work with theseuncertainties to provide stronger error correction. This approach of working withthe uncertainty of a bit is calledsoft-decision decoding.Conversely,decidingwhether each bit is a 0 or a 1 before subsequent error correction is calledhard-decision decoding.The third kind of error-correcting code we will describe is theReed-Solomoncode.LikeHamming codes, Reed-Solomon codes are linear block codes, and theyare often systematic, too.UnlikeHamming codes, which operate on individualbits, Reed-Solomon codes operate onmbit symbols. Naturally,the mathematicsare more involved, so we will describe their operation by analogy.Reed-Solomon codes are based on the fact that everyndegree polynomial isuniquely determined byn+ 1points. For example, a line having the formax+ bisdetermined by twopoints. Extra points on the same line are redundant, which ishelpful for error correction. Imagine that we have two data points that represent aline and we send those twodata points plus twocheck points chosen to lie on thesame line.If one of the points is receivedinerror,wecan still recoverthe datapoints by fitting a line to the receivedpoints. Threeof the points will lie on theline, and one point, the one in error,will not.By finding the line we have correctedthe error.Reed-Solomon codes are actually defined as polynomials that operate overfinite fields, but theywork in a similar manner.Form-bit symbols, the codewordsare 2m< 1symbols long.Apopular choice is to makem= 8sothat symbols arebytes. A codeword is then 255 bytes long. The (255, 233) code is widely used; itadds 22 redundant symbols to 233 data symbols.Decoding with error correction is'),\n",

Theyare used for DSL,data overcable, satellite communications, and perhaps most ubiquitously on CDs,DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. Because theyare based onm-bit symbols, a single-biterror and anm-bit burst error are both treated simply as one symbol error.When2tredundant symbols are added, a Reed-Solomon code is able to correct up toterrorsin anyofthe transmitted symbols.This means, for example, that the (255, 233)code, which has 32 redundant symbols, can correct up to 16 symbol errors. Sincethe symbols may be consecutive and theyare each 8 bits, an error burst of up to128 bits can be corrected. The situation is evenbetter if the error model is one oferasures (e.g., a scratch on a CD that obliterates some symbols). In this case, up to2terrors can be corrected.Reed-Solomon codes are often used in combination with other codes such as aconvolutional code. The thinking is as follows. Convolutional codes are effectiveat handling isolated bit errors, but theywill fail, likely with a burst of errors, ifthere are too manyerrors in the receivedbit stream.By adding a Reed-Solomoncode within the convolutional code, the Reed-Solomon decoding can mop up theerror bursts, a task at which it is very good. The overall code then provides goodprotection against both single and burst errors.The final error-correcting code we will coveristheLDPC(Low-Density Par-ity Check)code. LDPC codes are linear block codes that were invented by RobertGallagher in his doctoral thesis (Gallagher,1962). Likemost theses, theywerepromptly forgotten, only to be reinvented in 1995 when advances in computingpower had made them practical.In an LDPC code, each output bit is formed from only a fraction of the inputbits. This leads to a matrix representation of the code that has a lowdensity of 1s,hence the name for the code.The receivedcodewords are decoded with an approx-imation algorithm that iteratively improvesonabest fit of the receiveddata to alegalcodeword. This corrects errors.LDPC codes are practical for large block sizes and have excellent error-cor-rection abilities that outperform manyother codes (including the ones we havelooked at) in practice.Forthis reason, theyare rapidly being included in newpro-tocols. Theyare part of the standard for digital video broadcasting, 10 Gbps Ether-net, power-line networks, and the latest version of 802.11. Expect to see more ofthem in future networks.3.2.2 Error-Detecting CodesError-correcting codes are widely used on wireless links, which are notoriouslynoisy and error prone when compared to optical fibers. Without error-correctingcodes, it would be difficult to get anything through them.However, overfiber or'),\n",

Parity.2. Checksums.3. CyclicRedundancyChecks (CRCs).To see howtheycan be more efficient than error-correcting codes, consider thefirst error-detecting code, in which a singleparity bitis appended to the data.Theparity bit is chosen so that the number of 1 bits in the codeword is even(or odd).Doing this is equivalent to computing the (even) parity bit as the modulo 2 sum orXOR of the data bits.Forexample, when 1011010 is sent in evenparity,abit isadded to the end to makeit10110100. With odd parity 1011010 becomes10110101. Acode with a single parity bit has a distance of 2, since anysingle-biterror produces a codeword with the wrong parity.This means that it can detectsingle-bit errors.Consider a channel on which errors are isolated and the error rate is 10< 6perbit. Thismay seem a tinyerror rate, but it is at best a fair rate for a long wiredcable. Typical LAN links provide bit error rates of 10< 10.2 Let the block size be1000 bits.To provide error correction for 1000-bit blocks, we knowfrom Eq.(3-1)that 10 check bits are needed. Thus, a megabit of data would require 10,000 checkbits. Tomerely detect a block with a single 1-bit error,one parity bit per block willsuffice. Onceevery 1000 blocks, a block will be found to be in error and an extrablock (1001 bits) will have tobetransmitted to repair the error.The total overheadfor the error detection and retransmission method is only 2001 bits per megabit ofdata, versus 10,000 bits for a Hamming code.One difficulty with this scheme is that a single parity bit can only reliablydetect a single-bit error in the block.If the block is badly garbled by a long bursterror,the probability that the error will be detected is only 0.5, which is hardly ac-ceptable. Theodds can be improvedconsiderably if each block to be sent isregarded as a rectangular matrixnbits wide andkbits high.Now, ifwecomputeand send one parity bit for each row, uptok-bit errors will be reliably detected aslong as there is at most one error per row.However, there is something else we can do that provides evenbetter protec-tion against burst errors: we can compute the parity bits overthe data in a differentorder than the order in which the data bits are actually transmitted overthe com-munications channel.Doing so is calledinterleaving.Inthis case, we will com-pute a parity bit for each of thencolumns and send all the data bits askrows,sending the rows from top to bottom and the bits in each rowfrom left to right inthe usual manner.Atthe last row, wesend thenparity bits.This transmissionorder is shown in Fig. 3-8 forn= 7andk= 7.'),\n",

In Fig.3-8, when aburst error of lengthn= 7occurs, the bits that are in error are spread across dif-ferent columns.(A burst error does not imply that all the bits are wrong; it justimplies that at least the first and last are wrong. In Fig.3-8, 4 bits were flippedoverarange of 7 bits.)At most 1 bit in each of thencolumns will be affected, sothe parity bits on those columns will detect the error.This method usesnparitybits on blocks ofkndata bits to detect a single burst error of lengthnor less.Aburst of lengthn+ 1will pass undetected, however, ifthe first bit isinverted, the last bit is inverted, and all the other bits are correct.If the block isbadly garbled by a long burst or by multiple shorter bursts, the probability that anyof thencolumns will have the correct parity by accident is 0.5, so the probabilityof a bad block being accepted when it should not be is 2< n.The second kind of error-detecting code, thechecksum,isclosely related togroups of parity bits. The word ‘‘checksum’’isoften used to mean a group ofcheck bits associated with a message, regardless of howthe bits are calculated. Agroup of parity bits is one example of a checksum. However, there are other,stronger checksums based on a running sum of the data bits of the message. Thechecksum is usually placed at the end of the message, as the complement of thesum function. This way,errors may be detected by summing the entire receivedcodeword, both data bits and checksum.If the result comes out to be zero, no errorhas been detected.One example of a checksum is the 16-bit Internet checksum used on all Inter-net packets as part of the IP protocol (Braden et al., 1988).This checksum is asum of the message bits divided into 16-bit words. Because this method operateson words rather than on bits, as in parity,errors that leave the parity unchanged canstill alter the sum and be detected.Forexample, if the lowest-order bit in twodif-ferent words is flipped from a 0 to a 1, a parity check across these bits would fail todetect an error.However, two 1swill be added to the 16-bit checksum to produce adifferent result. The error can then be detected.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 243}, page_content='220 THE DAT ALINK LAYER CHAP.3The Internet checksum is computed in one’scomplement arithmetic instead ofas the modulo 216sum. Inone’scomplement arithmetic, a negative number is thebitwise complement of its positive counterpart. Moderncomputers normally usetwo’scomplement arithmetic, in which a negative number is the one’scomplementplus one.On a two’scomplement computer,the one’scomplement sum is equiv-alent to taking the sum modulo 216and adding anyoverflowofthe high-order bitsback into the low-order bits.This algorithm givesamore uniform coverage of thedata by the checksum bits. Otherwise, twohigh-order bits can be added, overflow,and be lost without changing the sum.There is another benefit, too. One’scomple-ment has tworepresentations of zero, all 0s and all 1s. This allows one value (e.g.,all 0s) to indicate that there is no checksum, without the need for another field.Fordecades, it has always been assumed that frames to be checksummed con-tain random bits.All analyses of checksum algorithms have been made under thisassumption. Inspectionof real data by Partridge et al. (1995) has shown this as-sumption to be quite wrong.As a consequence, undetected errors are in somecases much more common than had been previously thought.The Internet checksum, in particular,isefficient and simple but provides weakprotection in some cases precisely because it is a simple sum. It does not detect thedeletion or addition of zero data, nor swapping parts of the message, and it pro-vides weak protection against message splices in which parts of twopackets areput together.These errors may seem very unlikely to occur by random processes,buttheyare just the sort of errors that can occur with buggy hardware.Abetter choice isFletcher’schecksum(Fletcher,1982). Itincludes a posi-tional component, adding the product of the data and its position to the runningsum. This provides stronger detection of changes in the position of data.Although the twopreceding schemes may sometimes be adequate at higherlayers, in practice, a third and stronger kind of error-detecting code is in wide-spread use at the link layer: theCRC(Cyclic Redundancy Check), also known asapolynomial code.Polynomial codes are based upon treating bit strings asrepresentations of polynomials with coefficients of 0 and 1 only.Ak-bit frame isregarded as the coefficient list for a polynomial withkterms, ranging fromxk< 1tox0.Such a polynomial is said to be of degreek< 1. Thehigh-order (leftmost) bitis the coefficient ofxk< 1,the next bit is the coefficient ofxk< 2,and so on.Forex-ample, 110001 has 6 bits and thus represents a six-term polynomial with coef-ficients 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, and 1: 1x5+ 1x4+ 0x3+ 0x2+ 0x1+ 1x0.Polynomial arithmetic is done modulo 2, according to the rules of algebraicfield theory.Itdoes not have carries for addition or borrows for subtraction. Bothaddition and subtraction are identical to exclusive OR. For example:10011011 00110011 11110000 01010101+11001010 +11001101 ï 10100110 ï 1010111101010001 11111110 01010110 11111010'),\n",

Boththe high- and low-order bits of the generator must be 1.To compute the CRC for some frame withmbits corresponding to the polynomialM(x), the frame must be longer than the gen-erator polynomial.The idea is to append a CRC to the end of the frame in such awaythat the polynomial represented by the checksummed frame is divisible byG(x). Whenthe receivergets the checksummed frame, it tries dividing it byG(x).If there is a remainder,there has been a transmission error.The algorithm for computing the CRC is as follows:1. Letrbe the degree ofG(x). Appendrzero bits to the low-order endof the frame so it nowcontainsm+ rbits and corresponds to thepolynomialxrM(x).2. Divide the bit string corresponding toG(x)into the bit string corres-ponding toxrM(x), using modulo 2 division.3. Subtractthe remainder (which is alwaysror fewer bits) from the bitstring corresponding toxrM(x)using modulo 2 subtraction.The re-sult is the checksummed frame to be transmitted.Call its polynomialT(x).Figure 3-9 illustrates the calculation for a frame 1101011111 using the generatorG(x)= x4+ x+ 1.It should be clear thatT(x)isdivisible (modulo 2) byG(x). Inanydivisionproblem, if you diminish the dividend by the remainder,what is left overisdivisi-ble by the divisor.For example, in base 10, if you divide 210,278 by 10,941, theremainder is 2399.If you then subtract 2399 from 210,278, what is left over(207,879) is divisible by 10,941.Nowlet us analyze the power of this method.What kinds of errors will be de-tected? Imaginethat a transmission error occurs, so that instead of the bit stringforT(x)arriving,T(x)+ E(x)arrives. Each1bit inE(x)corresponds to a bit thathas been inverted. Ifthere arek1bits inE(x),ksingle-bit errors have occurred. Asingle burst error is characterized by an initial 1, a mixture of 0s and 1s, and a final1, with all other bits being 0.Upon receiving the checksummed frame, the receiverdivides it byG(x); thatis, it computes [T(x)+ E(x)]/G(x).T(x)/G(x)is0,sothe result of the computa-tion is simplyE(x)/G(x). Thoseerrors that happen to correspond to polynomialscontainingG(x)asafactor will slip by; all other errors will be caught.If there has been a single-bit error,E(x)= xi,whereidetermines which bit isin error.IfG(x)contains twoormore terms, it will neverdivide intoE(x), so allsingle-bit errors will be detected.'),\n",

Bydefinition of a burst, the first and lastbits must be 1, so whether it matches depends on ther< 1intermediate bits.If allcombinations are regarded as equally likely,the probability of such an incorrectframe being accepted as valid is ½r< 1.It can also be shown that when an error burst longer thanr+ 1bits occurs orwhen several shorter bursts occur,the probability of a bad frame getting throughunnoticed is ½r,assuming that all bit patterns are equally likely.Certain polynomials have become international standards.The one used inIEEE 802 followed the example of Ethernet and isx32+ x26+ x23+ x22+ x16+ x12+ x11+ x10+ x8+ x7+ x5+ x4+ x2+ x1+ 1Among other desirable properties, it has the property that it detects all bursts oflength 32 or less and all bursts affecting an odd number of bits. It has been usedwidely since the 1980s.However, this does not mean it is the best choice.Usingan exhaustive computational search, Castagnoli et al. (1993) and Koopman (2002)found the best CRCs.These CRCs have a Hamming distance of 6 for typical mes-sage sizes, while the IEEE standard CRC-32 has a Hamming distance of only 4.Although the calculation required to compute the CRC may seem complicated,it is easy to compute and verify CRCs in hardware with simple shift register cir-cuits (Peterson and Brown, 1961).Newer and faster implementations are inventedregularly (Mitra and Nyack, 2017).In practice, hardware is nearly always used.Dozens of networking standards include various CRCs, including virtually allLANs (e.g., Ethernet, 802.11) and point-to-point links (e.g., packets overSONET).3.3 ELEMENTARYDAT ALINK PROTOCOLSTo introduce the subject of protocols, we will begin by looking at three proto-cols of increasing complexity.Before we look at the protocols, it is useful to makeexplicit some of the assumptions underlying the model of communication.3.3.1 InitialSimplifying AssumptionsIndependent Processes.To start with, we assume that the physical layer,datalink layer,and network layer are independent processes that communicate by pas-sing messages back and forth.Acommon implementation is shown in Fig.3-10.The physical layer process and some of the data link layer process run on dedicatedhardware called aNIC(Network Interface Card). Therest of the link layer proc-ess and the network layer process run on the main CPU as part of the operatingsystem, with the software for the link layer process often taking the form of ade-vice driver.However, other implementations are also possible (e.g., three proc-esses offloaded to dedicated hardware called anetwork accelerator,orthree'),\n",

Thatis, these protocols deal with communication errors, but not the prob-lems caused by computers crashing and rebooting.As far as the data link layer is concerned, the packet passed across the interfaceto it from the network layer is pure data, whose every bit is to be delivered to thedestination’snetwork layer.The fact that the destination’snetwork layer mayinterpret part of the packet as a header is of no concern to the data link layer.3.3.2 BasicTransmission and ReceiptWhen the data link layer accepts a packet from the network layer at the sender,it encapsulates the packet in a frame by adding a data link header and trailer to it(see Fig.3-1). Thus,aframe consists of an embedded packet, some control infor-mation (in the header), and a checksum (in the trailer).The frame is then trans-mitted to the data link layer on the other machine.We will assume that there existsuitable library procedurestophysicallayerto send a frame andfromphysi-callayerto receive a frame. Theseprocedures compute and append or check thechecksum (which is usually done in hardware) so that we do not need to worry'),\n",

Theymight use theCRC algorithm discussed in the previous section, for example.Initially,the receiverhas nothing to do.It just sits around waiting for some-thing to happen.In the example protocols throughout this chapter,wewill indicatethat the data link layer is waiting for something to happen by the procedure callwaitforevent(&event). Thisprocedure only returns when something has hap-pened (e.g., a frame has arrived). Uponreturn, the variableeventtells what hap-pened. Theset of possible events differs for the various protocols to be describedand will be defined separately for each protocol.Note that in a more realisticsituation, the data link layer will not sit in a tight loop waiting for an event, as wehave suggested, but will receive aninterrupt, which will cause it to stop whateveritwasdoing and go handle the incoming frame.Nevertheless, for simplicity.wewillignore all the details of parallel activity within the data link layer and assume thatit is dedicated full time to handling just our one channel.When a frame arrivesatthe receiver, the receivercomputes the checksum.Ifthe checksum in the frame is incorrect (i.e., there was a transmission error), thedata link layer is so informed (event= cksumerr). Ifthe inbound frame arrivedundamaged, the data link layer is also informed (event= framearrival)sothat itcan acquire the frame for inspection usingfromphysicallayer.Assoon as the re-ceiving data link layer has acquired an undamaged frame, it checks the controlinformation in the header,and, if everything is all right, passes the packet portionto the network layer.Under no circumstances is a frame header evergiventoanet-work layer.There is a good reason whythe network layer must neverbegivenany part ofthe frame header: to keep the network and data link protocols completely separate.As long as the network layer knows nothing at all about the data link protocol orthe frame format, these things can be changed without requiring changes to thenetwork layer’ssoftware. Thishappens wheneveranew NIC is installed in a com-puter.Providing a rigid interface between the network and data link layers greatlysimplifies the design task because communication protocols in different layers canevolveindependently.Figure 3-11 shows some declarations (in C) common to manyofthe protocolsto be discussed later.Fivedata structures are defined there:boolean,seqnr,packet,framekind,andframe.Abooleanis an enumerated type and can takeonthe valuestrueandfalse.Aseqnris a small integer used to number the frames sothat we can tell them apart.These sequence numbers run from 0 up to and includ-ingMAXSEQ,which is defined in each protocol needing it.Apacketis the unitof information exchanged between the network layer and the data link layer on thesame machine, or between network layer peers.In our model, it always containsMAXPKTbytes, but more realistically it would be of variable length.Aframehas four fields:kind,seq,ack,andinfo,the first three of which containcontrol information and the last of which may contain actual data to be transferred.These control fields are collectively called theframe header.'),\n",

Theseare library routineswhose details are implementation dependent and whose inner workings will notconcern us further in the following discussions.The procedurewaitforeventsitsin a tight loop waiting for something to happen, as mentioned earlier.The proce-durestonetworklayerandfromnetworklayerare used by the data link layer topass packets to the network layer and accept packets from the network layer,re-spectively.Note thatfromphysicallayerandtophysicallayerpass frames be-tween the data link layer and the physical layer.Inother words,tonetworklayerandfromnetworklayerdeal with the interface between layers 2 and 3, whereasfromphysicallayerandtophysicallayerdeal with the interface between layers1and 2.In most of the protocols, we assume that the channel is unreliable and loses en-tire frames upon occasion.To beable to recoverfrom such calamities, the sendingdata link layer must start an internal timer or clock wheneveritsends a frame.Ifno reply has been receivedwithin a certain predetermined time interval, the clocktimes out and the data link layer receivesaninterrupt signal.In our protocols, this is handled by allowing the procedurewaitforeventtoreturnevent= timeout.The proceduresstarttimerandstoptimerturn the timeron and off, respectively.Timeout events are possible only when the timer is run-ning, of course, and beforestoptimeris called.It is explicitly permitted to callstarttimerwhile the timer is running; such a call simply resets the clock to causethe next timeout after a full timer interval has elapsed (unless it is reset or turnedoff).The proceduresstartacktimerandstopacktimercontrol an auxiliary timerused to generate acknowledgements under certain conditions.The proceduresenablenetworklayeranddisablenetworklayerare used inthe more sophisticated protocols, where we no longer assume that the networklayer always has packets to send.When the data link layer enables the networklayer,the network layer is then permitted to interrupt when it has a packet to besent. Weindicate this withevent= networklayerready.When the networklayer is disabled, it may not cause such events. Bybeing careful about when itenables and disables its network layer,the data link layer can prevent the networklayer from swamping it with packets for which it has no buffer space.'),\n",

InC, this merging is done by putting the definitions in a specialheader file, in this caseprotocol.h,and using the#includefacility of the C preproc-essor to include them in the protocol files.3.3.3 SimplexLink-Layer ProtocolsIn this section, we will examine three simple protocols, each able to handle amore realistic situation than the previous one.Utopia: No FlowControl or Error CorrectionAs an initial example, we will consider a protocol that is as simple as it can bebecause it does not worry about the possibility of anything going wrong.Data aretransmitted in one direction only.Both the transmitting and receiving network lay-ers are always ready.Processing time can be ignored.Infinite buffer space isavailable. Andbest of all, the communication channel between the data link layersneverdamages or loses frames.This thoroughly unrealistic protocol, which wewill nickname ‘‘Utopia,’’ issimply to showthe basic structure on which we willbuild. It’simplementation is shown in Fig. 3-12.The protocol consists of twodistinct procedures, a sender and a receiver. Thesender runs in the data link layer of the source machine, and the receiverruns inthe data link layer of the destination machine.No sequence numbers or acknowl-edgements are used here, soMAXSEQis not needed.The only event type pos-sible isframearrival(i.e., the arrivalofanundamaged frame).The sender is in an infinitewhileloop just pumping data out onto the line asfast as it can.The body of the loop consists of three actions: go fetch a packetfrom the (always obliging) network layer,construct an outbound frame using thevariables,and send the frame on its way.Only theinfofield of the frame is usedby this protocol, because the other fields have todowith error and flowcontrol andthere are no errors or flowcontrol restrictions here.The receiverisequally simple.Initially,itwaits for something to happen, theonly possibility being the arrivalofanundamaged frame.Eventually,the frame'),\n",

It must have sufficient buffering andprocessing abilities to run at the line rate and must be able to pass the frames thatare receivedtothe network layer quickly enough.However, this is a worst-casesolution. It requires dedicated hardware and can be wasteful of resources if the util-ization of the link is mostly low. Moreover, itjust shifts the problem of dealingwith a sender that is too fast elsewhere; in this case to the network layer.Amore general solution to this problem is to have the receiverprovide feed-back to the sender.After having passed a packet to its network layer,the receiversends a little dummy frame back to the sender which, in effect, givesthe senderpermission to transmit the next frame.After having sent a frame, the sender is re-quired by the protocol to bide its time until the little dummy (i.e., acknowledge-ment) frame arrives. Thisdelay is a simple example of a flowcontrol protocol.Protocols in which the sender sends one frame and then waits for an acknowl-edgement before proceeding are calledstop-and-wait.Figure 3-13 givesanex-ample of a simplexstop-and-wait protocol.Although data trafficinthis example is simplex, going only from the sender tothe receiver, frames do travelinboth directions.Consequently,the communicationchannel between the twodata link layers needs to be capable of bidirectional infor-mation transfer.However, this protocol entails a strict alternation of flow: first thesender sends a frame, then the receiversends a frame, then the sender sends anoth-er frame, then the receiversends another one, and so on.Ahalf-duplexphysicalchannel would suffice here.As in protocol 1, the sender starts out by fetching a packet from the networklayer,using it to construct a frame, and sending it on its way.But now, unlikeinprotocol 1, the sender must wait until an acknowledgement frame arrivesbeforelooping back and fetching the next packet from the network layer.The sendingdata link layer need not eveninspect the incoming frame as there is only one possi-bility.The incoming frame is always an acknowledgement.The only difference betweenreceiver1andreceiver2is that after delivering apacket to the network layer,receiver2sends an acknowledgement frame back tothe sender before entering the wait loop again. Becauseonly the arrivaloftheframe back at the sender is important, not its contents, the receiverneed not putanyparticular information in it.Adding Error Correction: Sequence Numbers and ARQNowlet us consider the normal situation of a communication channel thatmakes errors.Frames may be either damaged or lost completely.However, weas-sume that if a frame is damaged in transit, the receiverhardware will detect this'),\n",

Theduplicate frame also arrivesintact at the data link layer onBandis unwittingly passed to the network layer there.IfAis sending a filetoB,part of the file will be duplicated (i.e., the copyofthe file madebyBwill be incorrect and the error will not have been detected).Inother words, the protocol will fail.Clearly,what is needed is some way for the receivertobeable to distinguish aframe that it is seeing for the first time from a retransmission.The obvious way toachieve this is to have the sender put a sequence number in the header of eachframe it sends.Then the receivercan check the sequence number of each arrivingframe to see if it is a newframe or a duplicate to be discarded.Since the protocol must be correct and the sequence number field in the headeris likely to be small to use the link efficiently,the question arises: what is the mini-mum number of bits needed for the sequence number?The header might provide1bit, a fewbits, 1 byte, or multiple bytes for a sequence number depending on theprotocol. Theimportant point is that it must carry sequence numbers that are largeenough for the protocol to work correctly,oritisnot much of a protocol.The only ambiguity in this protocol is between a frame,m,and its direct suc-cessor,m+ 1. Ifframemis lost or damaged, the receiverwill not acknowledge it,so the sender will keep trying to send it.Once it has been correctly received, thereceiverwill send an acknowledgement to the sender.Itishere that the potentialtrouble crops up.Depending upon whether the acknowledgement frame gets backto the sender correctly or not, the sender may try to sendmorm+ 1.At the sender,the event that triggers the transmission of framem+ 1isthe ar-rivalofanacknowledgement for framem.But this situation implies thatm< 1hasbeen correctly received, and furthermore that its acknowledgement has also been'),\n",

Asaconsequence, the only ambiguityis between a frame and its immediate predecessor or successor,not between thepredecessor and successor themselves.A1-bit sequence number (0 or 1) is therefore sufficient. Ateach instant oftime, the receiverexpects a particular sequence number next. Whenaframe con-taining the correct sequence number arrives, it is accepted and passed to the net-work layer,then acknowledged. Thenthe expected sequence number is incre-mented modulo 2 (i.e., 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0).Anyarriving frame con-taining the wrong sequence number is rejected as a duplicate.However, the lastvalid acknowledgement is repeated so that the sender can eventually discoverthatthe frame has been received.An example of this kind of protocol is shown in Fig.3-14. Protocolsin whichthe sender waits for a positive acknowledgement before advancing to the next dataitem are often calledARQ(Automatic Repeat reQuest)orPAR(Positive Ac-knowledgement with Retransmission). Likeprotocol 2, this one also transmitsdata only in one direction.Protocol 3 differs from its predecessors in that both sender and receiverhaveavariable whose value is remembered while the data link layer is in the wait state.The sender remembers the sequence number of the next frame to send innextframetosend;the receiverremembers the sequence number of the nextframe expected inframeexpected.Each protocol has a short initialization phasebefore entering the infinite loop.After transmitting a frame, the sender starts the timer running.If it was al-ready running, it will be reset to allowanother full timer interval. Theintervalshould be chosen to allowenough time for the frame to get to the receiver, for thereceivertoprocess it in the worst case, and for the acknowledgement frame topropagate back to the sender.Only when that interval has elapsed is it safe to as-sume that either the transmitted frame or its acknowledgement has been lost, and tosend a duplicate.If the timeout interval is set too short, the sender will transmitunnecessary frames.While these extra frames will not affect the correctness of theprotocol, theywill hurt performance.After transmitting a frame and starting the timer,the sender waits for some-thing exciting to happen.Only three possibilities exist: an acknowledgementframe arrivesundamaged, a damaged acknowledgement frame staggers in, or thetimer expires. Ifavalid acknowledgement comes in, the sender fetches the nextpacket from its network layer and puts it in the buffer,overwriting the previouspacket. Italso advances the sequence number.Ifadamaged frame arrivesorthetimer expires, neither the buffer nor the sequence number is changed so that a dup-licate can be sent.In all cases, the contents of the buffer (either the next packet oraduplicate) are then sent.When a valid frame arrivesatthe receiver, its sequence number is checked tosee if it is a duplicate.If not, it is accepted, passed to the network layer,and an'),\n",

Ad-ditionally,the link layer can be more efficient if it can send multiple frames simul-taneously before receiving an acknowledgement. Weexplore both of these con-cepts next, and then provide several example protocols that achieve these goals.3.4.1 Goal:Bidirectional Transmission, Multiple Frames in FlightNext, we will explain a concept called piggybacking that can help a link layerprotocol achieve bidirectional transmission, and a concept called a sliding windowthat can improve transmission efficiencybyallowing the sender to have multiplebytes in flight.Bidirectional Transmission: PiggybackingOne way of achieving full-duplexdata transmission is to run twoinstances ofone of the previous protocols, each using a separate link for simplexdata traffic(indifferent directions).Each link is then comprised of a ‘‘forward’’channel (fordata) and a ‘‘reverse’’channel (for acknowledgements). Inboth cases, the capacityof the reverse channel is almost entirely wasted.Abetter idea is to use the same link for data in both directions.After all, inprotocols 2 and 3 it was already being used to transmit frames both ways, and thereverse channel normally has the same capacity as the forward channel.In thismodel the data frames fromAtoBare intermixed with the acknowledgementframes fromAtoB.Bylooking at thekindfield in the header of an incomingframe, the receivercan tell whether the frame is data or an acknowledgement.Although interleaving data and control frames on the same link is a big im-provement overhaving twoseparate physical links, yet another improvement ispossible. Whenadata frame arrives, instead of immediately sending a separatecontrol frame, the receiverrestrains itself and waits until the network layer passesit the next packet. Theacknowledgement is attached to the outgoing data frame(using theackfield in the frame header).In effect, the acknowledgement gets afree ride on the next outgoing data frame.The technique of temporarily delayingoutgoing acknowledgements so that theycan be hooked onto the next outgoingdata frame is known aspiggybacking.'),\n",

Inthe next protocol to beexamined, the piggyback field costs only 1 bit in the frame header.Itrarely costsmore than a fewbits.However, piggybacking introduces a complication not present with separateacknowledgements. Howlong should the data link layer wait for a packet ontowhich to piggyback the acknowledgement? Ifthe data link layer waits longer thanthe sender’stimeout period, the frame will be retransmitted, defeating the wholepurpose of having acknowledgements. Ifthe data link layer were an oracle andcould foretell the future, it would knowwhen the next network layer packet wasgoing to come in and could decide either to wait for it or send a separate acknowl-edgement immediately,depending on howlong the projected wait was going to be.Of course, the data link layer cannot foretell the future, so it must resort to some adhoc scheme, such as waiting a fixed number of milliseconds.If a newpacket ar-rivesquickly,the acknowledgement is piggybacked onto it.Otherwise, if no newpacket has arrivedbythe end of this time period, the data link layer just sends aseparate acknowledgement frame.Sliding WindowsThe next three protocols are bidirectional protocols that belong to a class call-edsliding windowprotocols. Thethree differ among themselves in terms of ef-ficiency, complexity,and buffer requirements, as discussed later.Inthese, as in allsliding windowprotocols, each outbound frame contains a sequence number,rang-ing from 0 up to some maximum.The maximum is usually 2n< 1sothe sequencenumber fits exactly in ann-bit field. Thestop-and-wait sliding windowprotocolusesn= 1, restricting the sequence numbers to 0 and 1, but more sophisticated ver-sions can use an arbitraryn.The essence of all sliding windowprotocols is that at anyinstant of time, thesender maintains a set of sequence numbers corresponding to frames it is permittedto send.These frames are said to fall within thesending window.Similarly,thereceiveralso maintains areceiving windowcorresponding to the set of frames it ispermitted to accept.The sender’swindowand the receiver’swindowneed nothave the same lower and upper limits or evenhavethe same size.In some proto-cols, theyare fixed in size, but in others theycan groworshrink overthe course oftime as frames are sent and received.Although these protocols give the data link layer more freedom about the orderin which it may send and receive frames, we have definitely not dropped the re-quirement that the protocol must deliverpackets to the destination network layer inthe same order theywere passed to the data link layer on the sending machine.'),\n",

Wheneveranewpacketarrivesfrom the network layer,itisgiventhe next highest sequence number,andthe upper edge of the windowisadvanced by one.When an acknowledgementcomes in, the lower edge is advanced by one.In this way,the windowcontinu-ously maintains a list of unacknowledged frames.Figure 3-15 shows an example.Sender\\nReceiver\\n76 15 2\\n0\\n43\\n76 15 2\\n0\\n43\\n76 15 2\\n0\\n43\\n76 15 2\\n0\\n43\\n76 15 2\\n0\\n43\\n76 15 2\\n0\\n43\\n76 15 2\\n0\\n43\\n76 15 2\\n0\\n43(a) (b) (c) (d)Figure3-15.Asliding windowofsize 1, with a 3-bit sequence number.(a) Ini-tially.(b) Afterthe first frame has been sent.(c) Afterthe first frame has beenreceived.

Unlikethe sender’swindow, the receiver’swindowalways remains at its initial size, rotating as thenext frame is accepted and delivered to the network layer.3.4.2 Examplesof Full-Duplex, Sliding WindowProtocolsWe now giveexamples of a simple one-bit sliding windowprotocol, as well asprotocols that can handle retransmission of erroneous frames when multiple framesare in flight.One-Bit Sliding WindowBefore tackling the general case, let us examine a sliding windowprotocolwith a windowsize of 1.Such a protocol uses stop-and-wait since the sendertransmits a frame and waits for its acknowledgement before sending the next one.Figure 3-16 depicts such a protocol.Likethe others, it starts out by definingsome variables.Nextframetosendtells which frame the sender is trying to send.Similarly,frameexpectedtells which frame the receiverisexpecting. Inbothcases, 0 and 1 are the only possibilities.Under normal circumstances, one of the twodata link layers goes first andtransmits the first frame.In other words, only one of the data link layer programsshould contain thetophysicallayerandstarttimerprocedure calls outside themain loop.The starting machine fetches the first packet from its network layer,builds a frame from it, and sends it.When this (or any) frame arrives, the receivingdata link layer checks to see if it is a duplicate, just as in protocol 3.If the frame isthe one expected, it is passed to the network layer and the receiver’swindowisslidup.The acknowledgement field contains the number of the last frame receivedwithout error.Ifthis number agrees with the sequence number of the frame thesender is trying to send, the sender knows it is done with the frame stored inbufferand can fetch the next packet from its network layer.Ifthe sequence number dis-agrees, it must continue trying to send the same frame.Wheneveraframe is re-ceived, a frame is also sent back.Nowlet us examine protocol 4 to see howresilient it is to pathological scen-arios. Assumethat computerAis trying to send its frame 0 to computerBand thatBis trying to send its frame 0 toA.Suppose thatAsends a frame toB,butA’stimeout interval is a little too short.Consequently,Amay time out repeatedly,sending a series of identical frames, all withseq= 0andack= 1.'),\n",

Inthese situations, the long round-trip time has important implications forthe efficiencyofthe bandwidth utilization.As an example, consider a 50-kbps sat-ellite channel with a 500-msec round-trip propagation delay.Imagine trying to useprotocol 4 to send 1000-bit frames via the satellite.Att= 0the sender starts send-ing the first frame.Att= 20 msec the frame has been completely sent.Not untilt= 270 msec has the frame fully arrivedatthe receiver, and not untilt= 520 msechas the acknowledgement arrivedatthe sender,under the best of circumstances (nowaiting in the receiverand a short acknowledgement frame).This means that thesender was blocked 500/520 or 96% of the time.In other words, only 4% of theavailable bandwidth was used.Clearly,the combination of a long transit time, highbandwidth, and short frame length is disastrous in terms of efficiency.The problem described here can be viewed as a consequence of the rule requir-ing a sender to wait for an acknowledgement before sending another frame.If werelax that restriction, much better efficiencycan be achieved. Basically,the solu-tion lies in allowing the sender to transmit up towframes before blocking, insteadof just 1.With a large enough choice ofwthe sender will be able to continuouslytransmit frames since the acknowledgements will arrive for previous frames beforethe windowbecomes full, preventing the sender from blocking.To find an appropriate value forwwe need to knowhow manyframes can fitinside the channel as theypropagate from sender to receiver. This capacity is deter-mined by the bandwidth in bits/sec multiplied by the one-way transit time, or thebandwidth-delay productof the link.We can divide this quantity by the numberof bits in a frame to express it as a number of frames.Call this quantityBD.Thenwshould be set to 2BD+ 1. Twice the bandwidth-delay is the number of framesthat can be outstanding if the sender continuously sends frames when the round-trip time to receive anacknowledgement is considered.The ‘‘+1’’isbecause anacknowledgement frame will not be sent until after a complete frame is received.Forthe example link with a bandwidth of 50 kbps and a one-way transit timeof 250 msec, the bandwidth-delay product is 12.5 kbit or 12.5 frames of 1000 bitseach. 2BD+ 1isthen 26 frames.Assume the sender begins sending frame 0 asbefore and sends a newframe every 20 msec.By the time it has finished sending26 frames, att= 520 msec, the acknowledgement for frame 0 will have just arri-ved. Thereafter,acknowledgements will arrive every 20 msec, so the sender willalways get permission to continue just when it needs it.From then onwards, 25 or26 unacknowledged frames will always be outstanding.Put in other terms, thesender’smaximum windowsize is 26.Forsmaller windowsizes, the utilization of the link will be less than 100%since the sender will be blocked sometimes.We can write the utilization as thefraction of time that the sender is not blocked:link utilization) w1+ 2BDThe value above isanupper bound because it does not allowfor anyframe proc-essing time and treats the acknowledgement frame as having zero length, since it is'),\n",

Ifthe delay is high, the sender will rapidlyexhaust its windowevenfor a moderate bandwidth, as in the satellite example. Ifthe bandwidth is high, evenfor a moderate delay the sender will exhaust its win-dowquickly unless it has a large window(e.g., a 1-Gbps link with 1-msec delayholds 1 megabit). With stop-and-wait for whichw= 1, if there is evenone frame’sworth of propagation delay the efficiencywill be less than 50%.This technique of keeping multiple frames in flight is an example ofpipelin-ing.Pipelining frames overanunreliable communication channel raises some seri-ous issues.First, what happens if a frame in the middle of a long stream is dam-aged or lost?Large numbers of succeeding frames will arrive atthe receiverbe-fore the sender evenfinds out that anything is wrong.When a damaged frame ar-rivesatthe receiver, itobviously should be discarded, but what should the receiverdo with all the correct frames following it?Remember that the receiving data linklayer is obligated to hand packets to the network layer in sequence.Twobasic approaches are available for dealing with errors in the presence ofpipelining, both of which are shown in Fig. 3-18.01\\n01 2345678EDDDDDD\\n234567823456789Timeout interval\\nErrorFrames discarded by data link layer\\nFrames bufferedby data link layer\\nAck0Ack1\\nTime(a)\\n(b)\\n01\\n01 91011121314E\\n234526789101112131415\\n8ErrorAck 0Ack 1Nak 24523 6Ack 5Ack 67Ack 7Ack 8Ack 9Ack 11Ack 12Ack 13Ack 10\\nAck 2Ack 3Ack 4Ack 5Ack 6Ack 7\\nFigure3-18.Pipelining and error recovery.Effect of an error when(a) receiver’swindowsize is 1 and (b) receiver’swindowsize is large.One option, calledgo-back-n,isfor the receivertojust discard all subsequentframes, sending no acknowledgements for the discarded frames.This strategy'),\n",

Frame2, however, isdamaged or lost.The sender,unaware of this problem, continues to send framesuntil the timer for frame 2 expires. Thenit backs up to frame 2 and starts overwithit, sending 2, 3, 4, etc. all overagain.Selective RepeatThe go-back-n protocol works well if errors are rare, but if the line is poor itwastes a lot of bandwidth on retransmitted frames.We need to do better than this.And it is possible.An alternative strategy,theselective repeatprotocol, is toallowthe receivertoaccept and buffer correct frames receivedfollowing a dam-aged or lost one.When it is used, a bad frame that is receivedisdiscarded, but anygood framesreceivedafter it are accepted and buffered. Whenthe sender times out, only theoldest unacknowledged frame is retransmitted.If that frame arrivescorrectly,thereceivercan delivertothe network layer,insequence, all the frames it has buff-ered. Selective repeat corresponds to a receiverwindowlarger than 1.This ap-proach can require large amounts of data link layer memory if the windowislarge.Selective repeat is often combined with having the receiversend a negative ac-knowledgement (NAK) when it detects an error,for example, when it receivesachecksum error or a frame out of sequence.NAKs stimulate retransmission beforethe corresponding timer expires and thus improve performance.In Fig.3-18(b), frames 0 and 1 are again correctly receivedand acknowledgedand frame 2 is lost.When frame 3 arrivesatthe receiver, the data link layer therenotices that it has missed a frame, so it sends back a NAK for 2 but buffers 3.When frames 4 and 5 arrive,they, too, are buffered by the data link layer instead ofbeing passed to the network layer.Eventually,the NAK 2 gets back to the sender,which immediately resends frame 2.When that arrives, the data link layer nowhas2, 3, 4, and 5 and can pass all of them to the network layer in the correct order.Itcan also acknowledge all frames up to and including 5, as shown in the figure.

Wewill see an eventighter restriction for the next protocol, selective repeat. Tosee whythis restrictionis required, consider the following scenario withMAXSEQ= 7:1. Thesender sends frames 0 through 7.2. Apiggybacked acknowledgement for 7 comes back to the sender.3. Thesender sends another eight frames, again with sequence numbers0through 7.4. Nowanother piggybacked acknowledgement for frame 7 comes in.The question is this: did all eight frames belonging to the second batch arrive suc-cessfully,ordid all eight get lost (counting discards following an error as lost)?Inboth cases, the receiverwould be sending frame 7 as the acknowledgement. Thesender has no way of telling.Forthis reason, the maximum number of outstandingframes must be restricted toMAXSEQ(and notMAXSEQ+ 1).Although protocol 5 does not buffer the frames arriving after an error,itdoesnot escape the problem of buffering altogether.Since a sender may have toretransmit all the unacknowledged frames at a future time, it must hang on to alltransmitted frames until it knows for sure that theyhavebeen accepted by the re-ceiver.When an acknowledgement comes in for framen,framesn< 1,n< 2, and soon are also automatically acknowledged. Thistype of acknowledgement is called acumulative acknowledgement.This property is especially important when someof the previous acknowledgement-bearing frames were lost or garbled. Wheneveranyacknowledgement comes in, the data link layer checks to see if anybuffers cannowbereleased. Ifbuffers can be released (i.e., there is some room available inthe window), a previously blocked network layer can nowbeallowed to causemorenetworklayerreadyevents.Forthis protocol, we assume that there is always reverse trafficonwhich topiggyback acknowledgements. Protocol4does not need this assumption since itsends back one frame every time it receivesaframe, evenifithas already sent thatframe. Inthe next protocol, we will solvethe problem of one-way trafficinanele-gant way.Because protocol 5 has multiple outstanding frames, it logically needs multipletimers, one per outstanding frame.Each frame times out independently of all theother ones.However, all of these timers can easily be simulated in software usingasingle hardware clock that causes interrupts periodically.The pending timeoutsform a linked list, with each node of the list containing the number of clock ticksuntil the timer expires, the frame being timed, and a pointer to the next node.'),\n",

Althoughthis organization requires the list to bescanned whenstarttimerorstoptimeris called, it does not require much workper tick.In protocol 5, both of these routines have been givenaparameter indicat-ing which frame is to be timed.In this protocol, both sender and receivermaintain a windowofoutstandingand acceptable sequence numbers, respectively.The sender’swindowsize startsout at 0 and grows to some predefined maximum.The receiver’swindow, incon-trast, is always fixed in size and equal to the predetermined maximum.The re-ceiverhas a buffer reserved for each sequence number within its fixed window.Associated with each buffer is a bit (arrived)telling whether the buffer is full orempty.Wheneveraframe arrives, its sequence number is checked by the functionbetweento see if it falls within the window. Ifsoand if it has not already been re-ceived, it is accepted and stored.This action is taken without regard to whether ornot the frame contains the next packet expected by the network layer.Ofcourse, itmust be kept within the data link layer and not passed to the network layer until allthe lower-numbered frames have already been delivered to the network layer in thecorrect order.Aprotocol using this algorithm is giveninFig. 3-21.Nonsequential receive introduces further constraints on frame sequence num-bers compared to protocols in which frames are only accepted in order.Wecanillustrate the trouble most easily with an example.

(d) After 4 frames have been sent and receivedbut not acknowledged.It is at this point that disaster strikes in the form of a lightning bolt hitting thetelephone pole and wiping out all the acknowledgements. Theprotocol should op-erate correctly despite this disaster.The sender eventually times out and retrans-mits frame 0.When this frame arrivesatthe receiver, a check is made to see if itfalls within the receiver’swindow. Unfortunately,inFig. 3-22(b)frame 0 is withinthe newwindow, soitisaccepted as a newframe. Thereceiveralso sends a (pig-gybacked) acknowledgement for frame 6, since 0 through 6 have been received.The sender is happytolearn that all its transmitted frames did actually arrivecorrectly,soitadvances its windowand immediately sends frames 7, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,and 5.Frame 7 will be accepted by the receiverand its packet will be passed di-rectly to the network layer.Immediately thereafter,the receiving data link layerchecks to see if it has a valid frame 0 already,discovers that it does, and passes theold buffered packet to the network layer as if it were a newpacket. Consequently,the network layer gets an incorrect packet, and the protocol fails.The essence of the problem is that after the receiveradvanced its window, thenewrange of valid sequence numbers overlapped the old one.Consequently,thefollowing batch of frames might be either duplicates (if all the acknowledgementswere lost) or newones (if all the acknowledgements were received). Thepoor re-ceiverhas no way of distinguishing these twocases.The way out of this dilemma lies in making sure that after the receiverhas ad-vanced its windowthere is no overlap with the original window. Toensure thatthere is no overlap, the maximum windowsize should be at most half the range ofthe sequence numbers.This situation is shown in Fig.3-22(c) and Fig.3-22(d).With 3 bits, the sequence numbers range from 0 to 7.Only four unacknowledged'),\n",

Thatway, ifthe receiverhas justaccepted frames 0 through 3 and advanced its windowtopermit acceptance offrames 4 through 7, it can unambiguously tell if subsequent frames are retransmis-sions (0 through 3) or newones (4 through 7).In general, the windowsize for pro-tocol 6 will be (MAXSEQ+ 1)/2.An interesting question is: howmanybuffers must the receiverhave?Underno conditions will it everaccept frames whose sequence numbers are belowthelower edge of the windoworframes whose sequence numbers are above the upperedge of the window. Consequently,the number of buffers needed is equal to thewindowsize, not to the range of sequence numbers.In the preceding example of a3-bit sequence number,four buffers, numbered 0 through 3, are needed.Whenframeiarrives, it is put in bufferimod 4.Notice that althoughiand (i+ 4) mod 4are ‘‘competing’’for the same buffer,theyare neverwithin the windowatthe sametime, because that would imply a windowsize of at least 5.Forthe same reason, the number of timers needed is equal to the number ofbuffers, not to the size of the sequence space.Effectively,one timer is associatedwith each buffer.When the timer runs out, the contents of the buffer are retrans-mitted.Protocol 6 also relaxes the implicit assumption that the channel is heavily load-ed. Wemade this assumption in protocol 5 when we relied on frames being sent inthe reverse direction on which to piggyback acknowledgements. Ifthe reverse traf-ficislight, the acknowledgements may be held up for a long period of time, whichcan cause problems.In the extreme, if there is a lot of trafficinone direction andno trafficinthe other direction, the protocol will block when the sender windowreaches its maximum.To relax this assumption, an auxiliary timer is started bystartacktimerafteran in-sequence data frame arrives. Ifno reverse traffichas presented itself beforethis timer expires, a separate acknowledgement frame is sent.An interrupt due tothe auxiliary timer is called anacktimeoutevent. With this arrangement, trafficflowinonly one direction is possible because the lack of reverse data frames ontowhich acknowledgements can be piggybacked is no longer an obstacle.Only oneauxiliary timer exists, and ifstartacktimeris called while the timer is running, ithas no effect. Thetimer is not reset or extended since its purpose is to providesome minimum rate of acknowledgements.It is essential that the timeout associated with the auxiliary timer be apprecia-bly shorter than the timeout used for timing out data frames.This condition is re-quired to ensure that a correctly receivedframe is acknowledged early enough thatthe frame’sretransmission timer does not expire and retransmit the frame.Protocol 6 uses a more efficient strategy than protocol 5 for dealing with er-rors. Wheneverthe receiverhas reason to suspect that an error has occurred, itsends a negative acknowledgement (NAK)frame back to the sender.Such a frameis a request for retransmission of the frame specified in theNAK.Intwo cases, thereceivershould be suspicious: when a damaged frame arrivesoraframe other than'),\n",

Thevariablenonakin protocol6istrueif noNAKhas been sent yet forframeexpected.IftheNAKgets mangledor lost, no real harm is done, since the sender will eventually time out and retrans-mit the missing frame anyway.Ifthe wrong frame arrivesafter aNAKhas beensent and lost,nonakwill betrueand the auxiliary timer will be started.When itexpires, anACKwill be sent to resynchronize the sender to the receiver’scurrentstatus.In some situations, the time required for a frame to propagate to the destina-tion, be processed there, and have the acknowledgement come back is (nearly) con-stant. Inthese situations, the sender can adjust its timer to be ‘‘tight,’’ just slightlylarger than the normal time interval expected between sending a frame and receiv-ing its acknowledgement.NAKsare not useful in this case.However, inother situations the round-trip time can be highly variable. Forexample, if the reverse trafficissporadic, the time before acknowledgement will beshorter when there is reverse trafficand longer when there is not.The sender isfaced with the choice of either setting the interval to a small value (and risking un-necessary retransmissions), or setting it to a large value (and going idle for a longperiod after an error).Both choices waste bandwidth.In general, if the standarddeviation of the acknowledgement interval is large compared to the interval itself,the timer is set ‘‘loose’’tobeconservative.NAKscan then appreciably speed upretransmission of lost or damaged frames.Closely related to the matter of timeouts andNAKsisthe question of determin-ing which frame caused a timeout.In protocol 5, it is alwaysackexpected,be-cause it is always the oldest.In protocol 6, there is no trivial way to determinewho timed out.Suppose that frames 0 through 4 have been transmitted, meaningthat the list of outstanding frames is 01234, in order from oldest to youngest.Nowimagine that 0 times out, 5 (a newframe) is transmitted, 1 times out, 2 times out,and 6 (another newframe) is transmitted.At this point, the list of outstandingframes is 3405126, from oldest to youngest.If all inbound traffic(i.e., acknowl-edgement-bearing frames) is lost for a while, the sevenoutstanding frames willtime out in that order.To keep the example from getting evenmore complicated than it already is, wehave not shown the timer administration.Instead, we just assume that the variableoldestframeis set upon timeout to indicate which frame timed out.3.5 DAT ALINK PROTOCOLS IN PRACTICEWithin a single building, LANs are widely used for interconnection, but mostwide area network infrastructure is built up from point-to-point lines.In Chap. 4,we will look at LANs.

The first situation iswhen packets are sent overSONET optical fiber links in wide area networks.These links are widely used, for example, to connect routers in the different loca-tions of an ISP’snetwork. Thesecond situation is for ADSL links running on thelocal loop of the telephone network at the edge of the Internet.The third situationis for DOCSIS links in the local loop of a cable network. BothADSL and DOC-SIS connect millions of individuals and businesses to the Internet.The Internet needs point-to-point links for these uses, as well as dial-upmodems, leased lines, cable modems, and so on.Astandard protocol calledPPP(Point-to-Point Protocol)isused to send packets overthese links.PPP is definedin RFC 1661 and further elaborated in RFC 1662 and other RFCs (Simpson,1994a, 1994b).SONET,ADSL, and DOCSIS links both apply PPP,but in dif-ferent ways.3.5.1 Packet overSONETSONET,which we covered in Sec. 2.5.3, is the physical layer protocol that ismost commonly used overthe wide area optical fiber links that makeupthe back-bone of communications networks, including the telephone system.It provides abitstream that runs at a well-defined rate, for example 2.4 Gbps for an OC-48 link.This bitstream is organized as fixed-size byte payloads that recur every 125µ sec,whether or not there is user data to send.To carry packets across these links, some framing mechanism is needed to dis-tinguish occasional packets from the continuous bitstream in which theyare tran-sported. PPPruns on IP routers to provide this mechanism, as shown in Fig.3-23.IPSONETPPPOpticalfiberRouter IP packetPPP frameSONET payloadSONET payload(a) (b)\\nIPSONETPPP\\nFigure3-23.Packet overSONET.(a) A protocol stack.

Awaytonegotiate network layer options in a way that is independentof the network layer protocol to be used.The method chosen is tohave a differentNCP(Network Control Protocol)for each networklayer supported.The PPP frame format was chosen to closely resemble the frame format ofHDLC(High-levelData Link Control), a widely used instance of an earlier fam-ily of protocols, since there was no need to reinvent the wheel.The primary difference between PPP and HDLC is that PPP is byte orientedrather than bit oriented.In particular,PPP uses byte stuffing and all frames are anintegral number of bytes. HDLC uses bit stuffing and allows frames of, for exam-ple, 30.25 bytes.There is a second major difference in practice, however. HDLC provides re-liable transmission with a sliding window, acknowledgements, and timeouts in themanner we have studied. PPPcan also provide reliable transmission in noisy envi-ronments, such as wireless networks; the exact details are defined in RFC 1663.However, this is rarely done in practice.Instead, an ‘‘unnumbered mode’’isnearlyalways used in the Internet to provide connectionless unacknowledged service.The PPP frame format is shown in Fig.3-24. AllPPP frames begin with thestandard HDLC flag byte of 0x7E (01111110). The flag byte is stuffed if it occurswithin thePayloadfield using the escape byte 0x7D. The following byte is theescaped byte XORed with 0x20, which flips the fifth bit. For example, 0x7D 0x5Eis the escape sequence for the flag byte 0x7E.This means the start and end offrames can be searched for simply by scanning for the byte 0x7E since it will notoccur elsewhere. The destuffing rule when receiving a frame is to look for 0x7D,remove it, and XOR the following byte with 0x20.Also, only one flag byte isneeded between frames. Multiple flag bytes can be used to fill the link when thereare no frames to be sent.After the start-of-frame flag byte comes theAddressfield. Thisfield is alwaysset to the binary value 11111111 to indicate that all stations are to accept theframe. Usingthis value avoids the issue of having to assign data link addresses.\\nFlag01111110 Flag01111110Address11111111ProtocolControl00000011PayloadChecksumBytes1 1 1 or 21 Variable2 or 4 1\\nFigure3-24.The PPP full frame format for unnumbered mode operation.'),\n",

Thisvalue indicates an unnumbered frame.Since theAddressandControlfields are always constant in the default config-uration, LCP provides the necessary mechanism for the twoparties to negotiate anoption to omit them altogether and save 2 bytes per frame.The fourth PPP field is theProtocolfield. Itsjob is to tell what kind of packetis in thePayloadfield. Codesstarting with a 0 bit are defined for IP version 4, IPversion 6, and other network layer protocols that might be used, such as IPX andAppleTalk. Codesstarting with a 1 bit are used for PPP configuration protocols,including LCP and a different NCP for each network layer protocol supported.The default size of theProtocolfield is 2 bytes, but it can be negotiated down to1byte using LCP.The designers were perhaps overly cautious in thinking thatsomeday there might be more than 256 protocols in use.ThePayloadfield is variable length, up to some negotiated maximum.If thelength is not negotiated using LCP during line setup, a default length of 1500 bytesis used.Padding may followthe payload if it is needed.After thePayloadfield comes theChecksumfield, which is normally 2 bytes,buta4-byte checksum can be negotiated. The 4-byte checksum is in fact the same32-bit CRC whose generator polynomial is givenatthe end of Sec. 3.2.2. The2-byte checksum is also an industry-standard CRC.PPP is a framing mechanism that can carry the packets of multiple protocolsovermanytypes of physical layers. Touse PPP overSONET,the choices to makeare spelled out in RFC 2615 (Malis and Simpson, 1999).A4-byte checksum isused, since this is the primary means of detecting transmission errors overthephysical, link, and network layers.It is recommended that theAddress,Control,andProtocolfields not be compressed, since SONET links already run at relativelyhigh rates.There is also one unusual feature. The PPP payload is scrambled (as describedin Sec. 2.4.3) before it is inserted into the SONET payload.Scrambling XORs thepayload with a long pseudorandom sequence before it is transmitted.The issue isthat the SONET bitstream needs frequent bit transitions for synchronization.These transitions come naturally with the variation in voice signals, but in datacommunication the user chooses the information that is sent and might send apacket with a long run of 0s.With scrambling, the likelihood of a user being ableto cause problems by sending a long run of 0s is made extremely low.Before PPP frames can be carried overSONET lines, the PPP link must be es-tablished and configured. Thephases that the link goes through when it is broughtup, used, and taken down again are shown in Fig. 3-25.The link starts in theDEADstate, which means that there is no connection atthe physical layer.When a physical layer connection is established, the link movestoESTABLISH.Atthis point, the PPP peers exchange a series of LCP packets,each carried in thePayloadfield of a PPP frame, to select the PPP options for thelink from the possibilities mentioned above.The initiating peer proposes options,'),\n",

Nowthe twoparties can check each other’sidentities, if desired.Ifauthentication is successful, theNETWORKstate is entered and a series of NCPpackets are sent to configure the network layer.Itisdifficult to generalize aboutthe NCP protocols because each one is specific to some network layer protocol andallows configuration requests to be made that are specific to that protocol.ForIP,for example, the assignment of IP addresses to both ends of the link is the most im-portant possibility.OnceOPENis reached, data transport can takeplace. Itis in this state that IPpackets are carried in PPP frames across the SONET line.When data transport isfinished, the link movesinto theTERMINATEstate, and from there it movesbackto theDEADstate when the physical layer connection is dropped.3.5.2 ADSL(Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop)ADSL connects millions of home subscribers to the Internet at megabit/secrates overthe same telephone local loop that is used for plain old telephone ser-vice. InSec. 2.5.2, we described howadevice called a DSL modem is added onthe home side. It sends bits overthe local loop to a device called a DSLAM (DSLAccess Multiplexer), pronounced ‘‘dee-slam,’’ inthe telephone company’slocaloffice.

It works in the same way to establish and configure the linkand carry IP packets.In between ADSL and PPP are ATM and AAL5. These are newprotocols thatwe have not seen before.ATM(Asynchronous Transfer Mode)was designed inthe early 1990s and launched with incredible hype. It promised a network technol-ogy that would solvethe world’stelecommunications problems by merging voice,data, cable television, telegraph, carrier pigeon, tin cans connected by strings, andeverything else into a single integrated system that could do everything for every-one. Thisdid not happen. In large part, the problems of ATM were similar to thosewe described concerning the OSI protocols, that is, bad timing, technology,imple-mentation, and politics. Nevertheless, ATM was at least much more successful thanOSI. While it has not taken overthe world, it remains widely used in niches includ-ing some broadband access lines such as DSL, and especially on WAN links insidetelephone networks.ATMisalink layer that is based on the transmission of fixed-lengthcellsofinformation. The‘‘ Asynchronous’’inits name means that the cells do not alwaysneed to be sent in the way that bits are continuously sent oversynchronous lines, asin SONET.Cells only need to be sent when there is information to carry.ATM isaconnection-oriented technology.Each cell carries avirtual circuitidentifier in'),\n",

This ability is useful when, for ex-ample, sending both voice and data overone link without having long data packetsthat would cause large variations in the delay of the voice samples.The unusualchoice for the cell length (e.g., compared to the more natural choice of a powerof 2)is an indication of just howpolitical the design of ATM was. The48-bytesize for the payload was a compromise to resolveadeadlock between Europe,which wanted 32-byte cells, and the U.S., which wanted 64-byte cells.AbriefoverviewofATM is givenbySiu and Jain (1995).To send data overanATM network, it needs to be mapped into a sequence ofcells. This mapping is done with an ATM adaptation layer in a process called seg-mentation and reassembly.Several adaptation layers have been defined for dif-ferent services, ranging from periodic voice samples to packet data. The main oneused for packet data isAAL5(ATMAdaptation Layer 5).An AAL5 frame is shown in Fig.3-27. Insteadof a header,ithas a trailer thatgivesthe length and has a 4-byte CRC for error detection.Naturally,the CRC isthe same one used for PPP and IEEE 802 LANs likeEthernet. Wang andCrowcroft (1992) have shown that it is strong enough to detect nontraditional er-rors such as cell reordering.As well as a payload, the AAL5 frame has padding.This rounds out the overall length to be a multiple of 48 bytes so that the frame canbe evenly divided into cells.No addresses are needed on the frame as the virtualcircuit identifier carried in each cell will get it to the right destination.PPP protocolPPP payloadPadUnusedLengthCRCBytes1 or 2 0 to 472 2 4\\nAAL5 trailer\\nVariable\\nAAL5 payloadFigure3-27.AAL5 frame carrying PPP data.Nowthat we have described ATM, we have only to describe howPPP makesuse of ATM in the case of ADSL.It is done with yet another standard calledPPPoA(PPP overATM). Thisstandard is not really a protocol (so it does notappear in Fig.3-26) but more a specification of howtowork with both PPP andAAL5 frames.It is described in RFC 2364 (Gross et al., 1998).Only the PPP protocol and payload fields are placed in the AAL5 payload, asshown in Fig.3-27. Theprotocol field indicates to the DSLAM at the far endwhether the payload is an IP packet or a packet from another protocol such as LCP.The far end knows that the cells contain PPP information because an ATM virtualcircuit is set up for this purpose.'),\n",

ThePPP CRC is also not needed because AAL5 already includes thevery same CRC. This error detection mechanism supplements the ADSL physicallayer coding of a Reed-Solomon code for error correction and a 1-byte CRC for thedetection of anyremaining errors not otherwise caught.This scheme has a muchmore sophisticated error-recovery mechanism than when packets are sent overaSONET line because ADSL is a much noisier channel.3.5.3 DataOver Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS)TheDOCSIS(Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification)protocol isgenerally described as having twocomponents: the physical (PHY) layer,asde-scribed in the previous chapter (sometimes called the PMD or physical mediadependent sublayer), and the Media Access Control (MAC) layer,which we willcoverinmore detail in Chapter 4.Above the physical layer,DOCSIS must handleavariety of tasks for the network layer,including bandwidth allocation in theupstream and downstream direction (flowcontrol), framing, and error correction(sometimes error correction is viewed as a physical layer construct, of course). Wehave described each of these concepts earlier in this chapter.Inthis section, weexplore howDOCSIS addresses each of these problems.ADOCSIS frame contains various information including quality of serviceindicators and support for fragmentation or concatenation of frames.Each unidi-rectional sequence of frames is called aservice flow.The primary service flowsallowthe CMTS (Cable Modem Termination System in the cable company’soffice) to communicate management messages to each cable modem.Each serviceflowhas a unique identifier and is often associated with a service class, which maybe best effort, polling (whereby a cable modem makes explicit requests for band-width), and grant service (whereby a cable modem transmits bursts of data at aguaranteed data date).Aprimary service flowisthe default service flowthat car-ries all frames that are not classified to another service.In the manybroadbandservice configurations, there is only a default upstream and default downstreamservice flowbetween the CM and CMTS that carries all user trafficaswell as allmanagement messages.DOCSIS networks have historically been designed assum-ing that most data is transmitted in the downstream direction. Certain applications,such as video conferencing, run counter to these trends, although recently announ-ced cloud-gaming services (e.g., Stadia, GeForce Now, xCloud) may result in evenmore downstream utilization, as these applications are targeting continuous stream-ing rates of 30–35 Mbps.Once a cable modem has been powered on, it establishes a connection to thethe CMTS, which typically allows it to connect to the rest of the network. Whenitregisters with the CMTS, it acquires upstream and downstream communicationchannels to use, as well as encryption keysfrom the CMTS. The upstream and'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 283}, page_content='260 THE DAT ALINK LAYER CHAP.3downstream carriers provide twoshared channels for all cable modems.In thedownstream direction, all cable modems connected to the CMTS receive everypacket transmitted.In the upstream direction, manycable modems transmit, andthe CMTS is the single receiver. There can be multiple physical paths between theCMTS and each cable modem.Prior to DOCSIS 3.1, packets in the downstream direction were divided into188-byte MPEG frames, each with a 4-byte header and a 184-byte payload (theso-called MPEG transmission convergence layer). In addition to the data itself, theCMTS periodically sends management information to the cable modem, which in-cludes information about ranging, channel assignment, and other tasks related tochannel allocation that are performed by the MAClayer (which we will coverinmore detail in Chapter 4). Although DOCSIS 3.1 still supports this convergencelayer for legacy purposes, it no longer relies on it for downstream communication.The DOCSIS link layer organizes transmission according tomodulation pro-files.Amodulation profile is a list of modulation orders (i.e., bit-loadings) thatcorrespond to the OFDM subcarriers.In the downstream direction, the CMTS mayuse different profiles for different cable modems, but typically,agroup of cablemodems that have the same or similar performance will be grouped into the sameprofile. Basedon the service flowidentification and QoS parameters, the linklayer (in DOCSIS 3.1), nowcalled theconvergence layer,groups packets thathave the same profile into the same send buffer; typically there is one send bufferper profile, each of which is shallowsoastoavoid significant latency. The code-word builder then maps each DOCSIS frame to the corresponding FEC codewords,pulling packets from different profile buffers only at each codeword boundary.FEC encoding views the DOCSIS frame as a bit stream, not as a sequence of bytes.DOCSIS relies on an LDPC codeword. Inthe downstream direction, a full code-word has up to 2027 bytes, of which up to 1799 bytes are data and 225 are parity.Within each byte of a DOCSIS frame, the least significant bit is transferred first;when a value that is more than one byte is transmitted, the bytes are ordered frommost significant to least significant, an order sometimes callednetwork order.The CMTS also adopts byte stuffing: if no DOCSIS frame is available in the down-stream direction, the CMTS inserts zero-bit-filled subcarriers into OFDM symbols,or simply stuffs sequences of 1s into codewords, as shown in Fig. 3-28.Since version 3.0, DOCSIS has supported a technology calledchannel bond-ing,which allows a single subscriber to use multiple upstream and downstreamchannels simultaneously.This technology is a form oflink aggregation,whichmay combine multiple physical links or ports to create a single logical connection.DOCSIS 3.0 allows up to 32 downstream channels and 8 upstream channels to bebonded, where each channel may be 6–8 MHz wide. Channel bonding in DOCSIS3.1 is the same as it was in DOCSIS 3.0, although DOCSIS 3.1 supports widerupstream and downstream channels: difference is that the upstream and down-stream channels can be much wider (up to 192 MHz in downstream, 96 MHz inupstream, as compared to 6 or 8 MHz downstream and up to 6.4 MHz upstream in'),\n",

Datalink protocols can provide error control to detect or correct damagedframes and to retransmit lost frames.To prevent a fast sender from overrunning aslowreceiver, the data link protocol can also provide flowcontrol. Theslidingwindowmechanism is widely used to integrate error control and flowcontrol in asimple way.When the windowsize is 1 packet, the protocol is stop-and-wait.Codes for error correction and detection add redundant information to mes-sages by using a variety of mathematical techniques. Convolutional codes andReed-Solomon codes are widely deployed for error correction, with low-densityparity check codes increasing in popularity.The codes for error detection that areused in practice include cyclic redundancychecks and checksums. All these codescan be applied at the link layer,aswell as at the physical layer and higher layers.We examined a series of protocols that provide a reliable link layer using ac-knowledgements and retransmissions, or ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest), undermore realistic assumptions.Starting from an error-free environment in which thereceivercan handle anyframe sent to it, we introduced flowcontrol, followed byerror control with sequence numbers and the stop-and-wait algorithm.Then weused the sliding windowalgorithm to allowbidirectional communication and intro-duce the concept of piggybacking.The last twoprotocols pipeline the transmis-sion of multiple frames to prevent the sender from blocking on a link with a long'),\n",

The former strategy is a go-back-n proto-col, and the latter strategy is a selective repeat protocol.The Internet uses PPP as the main data link protocol overpoint-to-point lines.It provides a connectionless unacknowledged service, using flag bytes to delimitframes and a CRC for error detection.It is used to carry packets across a range oflinks, including SONET links in wide area networks and ADSL links for the home.DOCSIS is used when Internet service is provided overthe existing cable TV net-work.

This chapter introduces these protocols.In anybroadcast network, the key issue involves determining who gets to usethe channel when there is competition for it.Forexample, consider a conferencecall in which six people, on six different telephones, are all connected so that eachone can hear and talk to everyone else.It is very likely that when one of themstops speaking, twoormore will start talking at once, leading to chaos.In a face-to-face meeting, chaos is often avoided by a second external channel.Forex-ample, at a meeting, people raise their hands to request permission to speak.Whenonly a single channel is available, it is much harder to determine who should gonext. Manyprotocols for solving the problem are known. Theyform the contentsof this chapter.Inthe literature, broadcast channels are sometimes referred to asmultiaccess channelsorrandom access channels.The protocols used to determine who goes next on a multiaccess channel be-long to a sublayer of the data link layer called theMAC(Medium Access Con-trol)sublayer.The MACsublayer is especially important in LANs, particularlywireless ones because wireless is naturally a broadcast channel.Some aspects of aWAN(e.g., a direct interconnect) are point-to-point; others (e.g., the shared accessnetwork in a cable ISP) are shared and also rely on the MAClayer to facilitatesharing.

It does not matter.Inboth cases, the channel connects each user to allother users and anyuser who makes full use of the channel interferes with otherusers who also wish to use the channel.We will first look at the shortcomings of static allocation schemes for burstytraffic. Then, we will lay out the key assumptions used to model the dynamicschemes that we examine in the following sections.4.1.1 StaticChannel AllocationThe conventional way of allocating a single channel, such as a telephone trunk,among multiple competing users is to chop up its capacity by using one of the mul-tiplexing schemes we described in Sec. 2.4.4, such as FDM (FrequencyDivisionMultiplexing). Ifthere areNusers, the bandwidth is divided intoNequal-sizedportions, with each user being assigned one portion.Since each user has a privatefrequencyband, there is nownointerference among users.When there is only asmall and constant number of users, each of which has a steady stream or a heavyload of traffic, this division is a simple and efficient allocation mechanism.Awireless example is FM radio stations. Each station gets a portion of the FM bandand uses it most of the time to broadcast its signal.However, when the number of senders is large and varying or the trafficisbursty,FDM presents some problems.If the spectrum is cut up intoNregions andfewer thanNusers are currently interested in communicating, a large piece of valu-able spectrum will be wasted. Andif more thanNusers want to communicate,some of them will be denied permission for lack of bandwidth, evenifsome of theusers who have been assigned a frequencyband hardly evertransmit or receiveanything.Even assuming that the number of users could somehowbeheld constant atN,dividing the single available channel into some number of static subchannels isinherently inefficient. Thebasic problem is that when some users are quiescent,'),\n",

Consequently,most of the channels will be idle most of the time.The poor performance of static FDM can easily be seen with a simple queue-ing theory calculation.Let us start by finding the mean time delay,T,tosend aframe onto a channel of capacityCbps. Weassume that the frames arrive ran-domly with an average arrivalrate ofh frames/sec, and that the frames vary inlength with an average length of 1/µbits. With these parameters, the service rateof the channel isµCframes/sec. Astandard queueing theory result isT=1µC< h (For the curious, this result is for an ‘‘M/M/1’’queue. Itrequires that the ran-domness of the times between frame arrivals and the frame lengths followanexpo-nential distribution, or equivalently be the result of a Poisson process.)In our example, ifCis 100 Mbps, the mean frame length, 1/µ,is10,000 bits,and the frame arrivalrate,h ,is5000 frames/sec, thenT=200µsec. Notethat ifwe ignored the queueing delay and just asked howlong it takes to send a10,000-bit frame on a 100-Mbps network, we would get the (incorrect) answer of100µsec. Thatresult only holds when there is no contention for the channel.Nowlet us divide the single channel intoNindependent subchannels, eachwith capacityC/Nbps. Themean input rate on each of the subchannels will nowbeh /N.RecomputingT,wegetTN=1µ(C/N)< (h /N)=NµC< h =NTThe mean delay for the divided channel isNtimes worse than if all the frameswere somehowmagically arranged orderly in a big central queue. This same resultsays that a bank lobby full of ATM machines is better offhaving a single queuefeeding all the machines than a separate partitioned queue in front of each machinebecause with separate queues, there may be idle ATMs while there are long lines atother ones.Precisely the same arguments that apply to FDM also apply to other ways ofstatically dividing the channel. If we were to use time division multiplexing (TDM)and allocate each user everyNth time slot, if a user does not use the allocated slot,it would just lie fallow. The same would hold if we split up the networks physi-cally.Using our previous example again, if we were to replace the 100-Mbps net-work with 10 networks of 10 Mbps each and statically allocate each user to one ofthem, the mean delay would jump from 200µsec to 2 msec.Since none of the traditional static channel allocation methods work well at allwith bursty traffic, we will nowexplore dynamic methods.'),\n",

Onceaframe has been generated, the stationis blocked and does nothing until the frame has been successfullytransmitted.2.Single Channel.Asingle channel is available for all communication.All stations can transmit on it and all can receive from it.The stationsare assumed to be equally capable, though protocols may assign themdifferent roles (e.g., priorities).3.Observable Collisions.Iftwo frames are transmitted simultan-eously,theyoverlap in time and the resulting signal is garbled. Thisevent is called acollision.All stations can detect that a collision hasoccurred. Acollided frame must be transmitted again later.Noerrorsother than those generated by collisions occur.4.Continuous or Slotted Time.Time may be assumed continuous, inwhich case frame transmission can begin at anyinstant. Alterna-tively,time may be slotted or divided into discrete intervals (calledslots). Frametransmissions must then begin at the start of a slot.Aslot may contain 0, 1, or more frames, corresponding to an idle slot, asuccessful transmission, or a collision, respectively.5.Carrier Sense or No Carrier Sense.With the carrier sense assump-tion, stations can tell if the channel is in use before trying to use it.No station will attempt to use the channel while it is sensed as busy.If there is no carrier sense, stations cannot sense the channel beforetrying to use it.Theyjust go ahead and transmit.Only later can theydetermine whether the transmission was successful.Some discussion of these assumptions is in order.The first one says that framearrivals are independent, both across stations and at a particular station, and thatframes are generated unpredictably but at a constant rate.Actually,this assump-tion is not a particularly good model of network traffic, as it has long been wellknown that packets come in bursts overarange of time scales (Paxson and Floyd,1995). Recentresearch confirms that the pattern still holds (Fontugne et al., 2017).Nonetheless,Poisson models,astheyare frequently called, are commonly used, in'),\n",

Theyhelp us analyze protocols tounderstand roughly howperformance changes overanoperating range and howitcompares with other designs.The single-channel assumption is the heart of the model.No external ways tocommunicate exist. Stationscannot raise their hands to request that the teachercall on them, so we will have tocome up with better solutions.The remaining three assumptions depend on the engineering of the system, andwe will say which assumptions hold when we examine a particular protocol.The collision assumption is basic. Stations need some way to detect collisionsif theyare to retransmit frames rather than let them be lost. For wired channels,node hardware can be designed to detect collisions when theyoccur.The stationscan then terminate their transmissions prematurely to avoid wasting capacity.Thisdetection is much harder for wireless channels, so collisions are usually inferredafter the fact by the lack of an expected acknowledgement frame.It is also pos-sible for some frames involved in a collision to be successfully received, dependingon the details of the signals and the receiving hardware. However, this situation isnot the common case, so we will assume that all frames involved in a collision arelost. Wewill also see protocols that are designed to prevent collisions from oc-curring in the first place.The reason for the twoalternative assumptions about time is that slotted timecan be used to improve performance. However, itrequires the stations to followamaster clock or synchronize their actions with each other to divide time into dis-crete intervals. Hence, it is not always available. Wewill discuss and analyze sys-tems with both kinds of time.Foragivensystem, only one of them holds.Similarly,anetwork may have carrier sensing or not.Wired networks willgenerally have carrier sense.Wireless networks cannot always use it effectivelybecause not every station may be within radio range of every other station.Simi-larly,carrier sense will not be available in other settings in which a station cannotcommunicate directly with other stations, for example a cable modem in which sta-tions must communicate via the cable headend.Note that the word ‘‘carrier’’inthis sense refers to a signal on the channel and has nothing to do with the commoncarriers (e.g., telephone companies) that date back to the days of the PonyExpress.To avoid anymisunderstanding, it is worth noting that no multiaccess protocolguarantees reliable delivery.Eveninthe absence of collisions, the receivermayhave copied some of the frame incorrectly for various reasons. Other parts of thelink layer or higher layers provide reliability.4.2 MULTIPLE ACCESS PROTOCOLSManyalgorithms for allocating a multiple access channel are known.

Inthis case, ‘‘pristine’’can be interpreted as ‘‘not having a working tele-phone system.’’ This did not makelife more pleasant for researcher NormanAbramson and his colleagues at the University of Hawaii who were trying to con-nect users on remote islands to the main computer in Honolulu.Stringing theirowncables under the Pacific Ocean for long distances was not in the cards, so theylooked for a different solution.The one theyfound used short-range radios, with each user terminal sharingthe same upstream frequencytosend frames to the central computer.Itincluded asimple and elegant method to solvethe channel allocation problem.Their workhas been extended by manyresearchers since then (Schwartz and Abramson,2009). AlthoughAbramson’swork, called the ALOHA system, used ground-based radio broadcasting, the basic idea is applicable to anysystem in which unco-ordinated users are competing for the use of a single shared channel.We will discuss twoversions of ALOHA here: pure and slotted.Theydifferwith respect to whether time is continuous, as in the pure version; or divided intodiscrete slots into which all frames must fit, as in the slotted version.PureALOHAThe basic idea of an ALOHA system is simple: let users transmit whenevertheyhavedata to be sent.There will be collisions, of course, and the collidingframes will be damaged.Senders need some way to find out if this is the case.Inthe ALOHA system, after each station has sent its frame to the central computer,this computer rebroadcasts the frame to all of the stations.Asending station canthus listen for the broadcast from the hub to see if its frame has gotten through.Inother systems, such as wired LANs, the sender might be able to listen for collisionswhile transmitting.If the frame was destroyed, the sender just waits a random amount of time andsends it again. Thewaiting time must be random or the same frames will collideoverand over, inlockstep. Systemsin which multiple users share a common chan-nel in a way that can lead to conflicts are known ascontention systems.Asketch of frame generation in an ALOHA system is giveninFig. 4-1.Wehave made the frames all the same length because the throughput of ALOHA sys-tems is maximized by having a uniform frame size rather than by allowing vari-able-length frames.Whenevertwo frames try to occupythe channel at the same time, there will beacollision (as seen in Fig.4-1) and both will be garbled. Ifthe first bit of a newframe overlaps with just the last bit of a frame that has almost finished, bothframes will be totally destroyed (i.e., have incorrect checksums) and both will have'),\n",

IfN>1,the user community is generating frames at a higher ratethan the channel can handle, and nearly every frame will suffer a collision.Forreasonable throughput, we would expect 0<N<1.In addition to the newframes, the stations also generate retransmissions offrames that previously suffered collisions.Let us further assume that the old andnewframes combined are well modeled by a Poisson distribution, with mean ofGframes per frame time.Clearly,G* N.Atlow load (i.e.,N5 0), there will befewcollisions, hence fewretransmissions, soG5 N.Athigh load, there will bemanycollisions, soG>N.Under all loads, the throughput,S,isjust the offeredload,G,times the probability,P0,ofatransmission succeeding—that is,S=GP0,whereP0is the probability that a frame does not suffer a collision.'),\n",

The probability of no other trafficduring the sameslot as our test frame is thene< G,which leads toS=Ge< GAs you can see from Fig.4-3, slotted ALOHA peaks atG=1,with a throughput ofS=1/eor about 0.368, twice that of pure ALOHA.If the system is operating atG=1, the probability of an empty slot is 0.368 (from Eq. 4-1).The best we canhope for using slotted ALOHA is 37% of the slots empty,37% successes, and 26%collisions. Operatingat higher values ofGreduces the number of empties but in-creases the number of collisions exponentially.Tosee howthis rapid growth ofcollisions withGcomes about, consider the transmission of a test frame.Theprobability that it will avoid a collision ise< G,which is the probability that all theother stations are silent in that slot.The probability of a collision is then just1< e< G.The probability of a transmission requiring exactlykattempts (i.e.,k< 1collisions followed by one success) is'),\n",

Itwasdevised in the 1970s, used in a fewearly experimental systems, then almostforgotten (except by eccentric textbook authors who liked it).When Internet ac-cess overthe cable was invented, all of a sudden there was a problem of howtoal-locate a shared channel among multiple competing users.Slotted ALOHA waspulled out of the garbage can, mixed with some newideas, and suddenly there wasasolution. Ithas often happened that protocols that are perfectly valid fall into dis-use for political reasons (e.g., some big companywants everyone to do things itsway) or due to ever-changing technology trends.Then, years later some cleverperson realizes that a long-discarded protocol solves a current problem.Forthisreason, in this chapter we will study a number of elegant protocols that are not cur-rently in widespread use but might easily be used in future applications, providedthat enough network designers are aware of them.Of course, we will also studymanyprotocols that are in current use as well.4.2.2 CarrierSense Multiple Access ProtocolsWith slotted ALOHA, the best channel utilization that can be achievedis1/e.This lowresult is hardly surprising, since with stations transmitting at will, withoutknowing what the other stations are doing there are bound to be manycollisions.In LANs, however, itisoften possible for stations to detect what other stations aredoing, and thus adapt their behavior accordingly.These networks can achieve amuch better utilization than 1/e.Inthis section, we will discuss some protocols forimproving performance.Protocols in which stations listen for a carrier (i.e., a transmission) and actaccordingly are calledcarrier sense protocols.Anumber of them have been pro-posed, and theywere long ago analyzed in detail.Forexample, see Kleinrock andTobagi (1975).Belowwewill look at several versions of carrier sense protocols.Persistent and Nonpersistent CSMAThe first carrier sense protocol that we will study here is called1-persistentCSMA(Carrier Sense Multiple Access). Thatis a bit of a mouthful for the sim-plest CSMA scheme.When a station has data to send, it first listens to the channelto see if anyone else is transmitting at that moment.If the channel is idle, the sta-tions sends its data.Otherwise, if the channel is busy,the station just waits until itbecomes idle. Then, the station transmits a frame.If a collision occurs, the station\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 300}, page_content='SEC. 4.2 MULTIPLE ACCESS PROTOCOLS 277waits a random amount of time and starts all overagain. Theprotocol is called1-persistent because the station transmits with a probability of 1 when it finds thechannel idle.Youmight expect that this scheme avoids collisions except for the rare case ofsimultaneous sends, but in fact it does not.It’smuch worse than that.If twosta-tions become ready in the middle of a third station’stransmission, both will waitpolitely until the transmission ends, and then both will begin transmitting exactlysimultaneously,resulting in a collision.If theywere not so impatient, there wouldbe fewer collisions.More subtly,the propagation delay has a very important effect on collisions.There is a chance that just after a station begins sending, another station will be-come ready to send and sense the channel.If the first station’ssignal has not yetreached the second one, the latter will sense an idle channel and will also beginsending, resulting in a collision.This chance depends on the number of framesthat fit on the channel, or thebandwidth-delay productof the channel.If only atinyfraction of a frame fits on the channel, which is the case in most LANs sincethe propagation delay is small, the chance of a collision happening is small.Thelarger the bandwidth-delay product, the more important this effect becomes, andthe worse the performance of the protocol.Even so, this protocol has better performance than pure ALOHA because bothstations have the decencytodesist from interfering with the third station’sframe,so it gets through undamaged.Exactly the same holds for slotted ALOHA.Asecond carrier sense protocol isnonpersistent CSMA.Inthis protocol, aconscious attempt is made to be less greedy than in the previous one.As before, astation senses the channel when it wants to send a frame, and if no one else is send-ing, the station begins doing so itself immediately.However, ifthe channel is al-ready in use, the station does not continually sense it for the purpose of seizing itimmediately upon detecting the end of the previous transmission.Instead, it waitsarandom period of time and then repeats the algorithm.Consequently,this algo-rithm leads to fewer collisions and better channel utilization but longer delays than1-persistent CSMA.The last protocol isp-persistent CSMA.Itapplies to slotted channels andworks as follows. Whenastation becomes ready to send, it senses the channel.Ifit is idle, it transmits with a probabilityp.With a probabilityq=1< p,itdefersuntil the next slot.If that slot is also idle, it either transmits or defers again, withprobabilitiespandq.This process is repeated until either the frame has beentransmitted or another station has begun transmitting.In the latter case, theunluckystation acts as if there had been a collision by waiting a random time andstaring again. Ifthe station initially senses that the channel is busy,itwaits untilthe next slot and then applies the above algorithm IEEE 802.1 uses a refinement ofp-persistent CSMA that we will discuss in Sec. 4.4.Figure 4-4 shows the computed throughput versus offered trafficfor all threeprotocols, as well as for pure and slotted ALOHA.'),\n",

Atthe point markedt0,astation has finished transmitting its frame.Anyother station having a frame to send may nowattempt to do so.If twoormore stations decide to transmit simultaneously,there will be a collision.If a sta-tion detects a collision, it aborts its transmission, waits a random period of time,and then tries again (assuming that no other station has started transmitting in themeantime).

Theanswer is vital to determining the length of thecontention period and hence what the delay and throughput will be.The minimum time to detect the collision is just the time it takes the signal topropagate from one station to the other.Based on this information, you mightthink that a station that has not heard a collision for a time equal to the full cablepropagation time after starting its transmission can be sure it has seized the cable.By ‘‘seized,’’ wemean that all other stations knowitistransmitting and will not in-terfere. Thisconclusion is wrong.Consider the following worst-case scenario.Let the time for a signal to propa-gate between the twofarthest stations beo .Att0,one station begins transmitting.Att0+o < ¡ ,aninstant before the signal arrivesatthe most distant station, thatstation also begins transmitting.Of course, it detects the collision almost instantlyand stops, but the little noise burst caused by the collision does not get back to theoriginal station until time 2o < ¡ .Inother words, in the worst case a station cannotbe sure that it has seized the channel until it has transmitted for 2o without hearingacollision.Starting with this understanding, we can think of CSMA/CD contention as aslotted ALOHA system with a slot width of 2o .Ona1-km-long coaxial cable,o 5 5µsec. Thedifference for CSMA/CD compared to slotted ALOHA is thatslots in which only one station transmits (i.e., in which the channel is seized) arefollowed by the rest of a frame.This difference will greatly improve performanceif the frame time is much longer than the propagation time.4.2.3 Collision-Free ProtocolsAlthough collisions do not occur with CSMA/CD once a station has unam-biguously captured the channel, theycan still occur during the contention period.These collisions adversely affect the system performance, in particular when the'),\n",

CSMA/CD is also not universally applicable.In this section, we will examine some protocols that resolvethe contention forthe channel without anycollisions at all, not evenduring the contention period.Most of these protocols are not currently used in major systems, but in a rapidlychanging field, having some protocols with excellent properties available for futuresystems is often a good thing.In the protocols to be described, we assume that there are exactlyNstations,each programmed with a unique address from 0 toN< 1. Itdoes not matter thatsome stations may be inactive part of the time.We also assume that propagationdelay is negligible. Thebasic question remains: which station gets the channelafter a successful transmission?We continue using the model of Fig.4-5 with itsdiscrete contention slots.ABit-Map ProtocolIn our first collision-free protocol, thebasic bit-map method,each contentionperiod consists of exactlyNslots. Ifstation 0 has a frame to send, it transmits a 1bit during the slot 0.No other station is allowed to transmit during this slot.Regardless of what station 0 does, station 1 gets the opportunity to transmit a 1 bitduring slot 1, but only if it has a frame queued.In general, stationjmay announcethat it has a frame to send by inserting a 1 bit into slotj.After allNslots havepassed by,each station has complete knowledge of which stations wish to transmit.At that point, theybegin transmitting frames in numerical order (see Fig. 4-6).\\n0111 1 11 15 1137234567 01234567 0123456718 Contention slots Frames 8 Contention slots 2d\\nFigure4-6.The basic bit-map protocol.Since everyone agrees on who goes next, there will neverbeany collisions.After the last ready station has transmitted its frame, an event all stations can easilymonitor,anotherN-bit contention period is begun. Ifastation becomes ready justafter its bit slot has passed by,itisout of luck and must remain silent until everystation has had a chance and the bit map has come around again.Protocols likethis in which the desire to transmit is broadcast before the actualtransmission are calledreservation protocolsbecause theyreservechannel owner-ship in advance and prevent collisions.Let us briefly analyze the performance of'),\n",

Themean delay for a frame is equal to thesum of the time it queues inside its station, plus an additional (N< 1)d+Nonce itgets to the head of its internal queue. This interval is howlong it takes to wait forall other stations to have their turn sending a frame and another bitmap.TokenPassingThe essence of the bit-map protocol is that it lets every station transmit a framein turn in a predefined order.Another way to accomplish the same thing is to passasmall message called atokenfrom one station to the next in the same predefinedorder.The token represents permission to send. If a station has a frame queued fortransmission when it receivesthe token, it can send that frame before it passes thetoken to the next station.If it has no queued frame, it simply passes the token.In atoken ringprotocol, the topology of the network is used to define theorder in which stations send. The stations are connected one to the next in a singlering. Passing the token to the next station then simply consists of receiving thetoken in from one direction and transmitting it out in the other direction, as seen inFig. 4-7.Frames are also transmitted in the direction of the token. Thiswaytheywill circulate around the ring and reach whicheverstation is the destination. How-ever, tostop the frame circulating indefinitely (likethe token), some station needsto remove itfrom the ring. This station may be either the one that originally sentthe frame, after it has gone through a complete cycle, or the station that was the in-tended recipient of the frame.Note that we do not need a physical ring to implement token passing.All thatis needed is a logical ring, where each station knows its predecessor and successor.The channel connecting the stations might instead be a single long bus (cable).'),\n",

Possession of the token allows a station to use the bus to send one frame.This protocol is calledtoken bus.Itisdefined in IEEE 802.4, a standard thatfailed so badly that IEEE has withdrawn it.Standards are not always forever.The performance of token passing is similar to that of the bit-map protocol,though the contention slots and frames of one cycle are nowintermingled. Aftersending a frame, each station must wait for allNstations (including itself) to sendthe token to their neighbors and the otherN< 1stations to send a frame, if theyhave one. Asubtle difference is that, since all positions in the cycle are equivalent,there is no bias for low- or high-numbered stations. For token ring, each station isalso sending the token only as far as its neighboring station before the protocoltakes the next step.Each token does not need to propagate to all stations before theprotocol advances to the next step.Tokenrings have cropped up as MACprotocols with some consistency. Anearly token ring protocol (called ‘‘Token Ring’’and standardized as IEEE 802.5)waspopular in the 1980s as an alternative toclassic Ethernet.In the 1990s, amuch faster token ring calledFDDI(Fiber Distributed Data Interface)wasbeaten out by switched Ethernet.In the 2000s, a token ring calledRPR(ResilientPacket Ring)was defined as IEEE 802.17 to standardize the mix of metropolitanarea rings in use by ISPs.We wonder what the 2020s will have tooffer.Binary CountdownAproblem with the basic bit-map protocol, and by extension token passing, isthat the overhead is 1 bit per station, so it does not scale well to networks with hun-dreds or thousands of stations.We can do better than that by using binary stationaddresses with a channel that combines transmissions in a certain way.Astationwanting to use the channel nowbroadcasts its address as a binary bit string, start-ing with the high-order bit.All addresses are assumed to be the same number ofbits. Thebits in each address position from different stations are BOOLEANORed together by the channel when theyare sent at the same time.We will call'),\n",

Itimplic-itly assumes that the transmission delays are negligible so that all stations seeasserted bits essentially instantaneously.To avoid conflicts, an arbitration rule must be applied: as soon as a station seesthat a high-order bit position that is 0 in its address has been overwritten with a 1,it givesup. For example, if stations 0010, 0100, 1001, and 1010 are all trying toget the channel, in the first bit time the stations transmit 0, 0, 1, and 1, respectively.These are ORed together to form a 1.Stations 0010 and 0100 see the 1 and knowthat a higher-numbered station is competing for the channel, so theygiveup for thecurrent round.Stations 1001 and 1010 continue.The next bit is 0, and both stations continue.The next bit is 1, so station 1001givesup. Thewinner is station 1010 because it has the highest address. After win-ning the bidding, it may nowtransmit a frame, after which another bidding cyclestarts. Theprotocol is illustrated in Fig.4-8. Ithas the property that higher-num-bered stations have a higher priority than lower-numbered stations, which may beeither good or bad, depending on the context.\\n0 0 1 00 – – –0 1 2 3Bit time\\n0 1 0 00 – – –1 0 0 11 0 0 –1 0 1 01 0 1 01 0 1 0ResultStations 0010and 0100 see this1 and give upStation 1001 sees this 1 and gives upFigure4-8.The binary countdown protocol.

Hopefully,itwill find a newhome some day.4.2.4 Limited-ContentionProtocolsWe havenowconsidered twobasic strategies for channel acquisition in abroadcast network: contention, as in CSMA, and collision-free protocols.Eachstrategy can be rated as to howwell it does with respect to the twoimportant'),\n",

Atlowload, theyhaverelatively high delay but as the load increases,the channel efficiencyimproves(since the overheads are fixed).Obviously,itwould be nice if we could combine the best properties of the con-tention and collision-free protocols, arriving at a newprotocol that used contentionat lowload to provide lowdelay,but used a collision-free technique at high load toprovide good channel efficiency. Such protocols, which we will calllimited-con-tention protocols,doinfact exist, and will conclude our study of carrier sense net-works.Up to now, the only contention protocols we have studied have been symmet-ric. That is, each station attempts to acquire the channel with some probability,p,with all stations using the samep.Interestingly enough, the overall system per-formance can sometimes be improvedbyusing a protocol that assigns differentprobabilities to different stations.Before looking at the asymmetric protocols, let us quickly reviewthe per-formance of the symmetric case.Suppose thatkstations are contending for chan-nel access.Each has a probabilitypof transmitting during each slot.Theprobability that some station successfully acquires the channel during a givenslotis the probability that anyone station transmits, with probabilityp,and all otherk< 1stations defer,each with probability 1< p.This value iskp(1< p)k< 1.Tofind the optimal value ofp,wedifferentiate with respect top,set the result to zero,and solveforp.Doing so, we find that the best value ofpis 1/k.Substitutingp=1/k,wegetPr[successwith optimalp]=£ ¤ k< 1k¥ ¦ k< 1\\nThis probability is plotted in Fig.4-9. For small numbers of stations, the chancesof success are good, but as soon as the number of stations reaches evenfive,theprobability has dropped close to its asymptotic value of 1/e.From Fig.4-9, it is fairly obvious that the probability of some station acquiringthe channel can be increased only by decreasing the amount of competition.Thelimited-contention protocols do precisely that.Theyfirst divide the stations into(not necessarily disjoint) groups.Only the members of group 0 are permitted tocompete for slot 0.If one of them succeeds, it acquires the channel and transmitsits frame.If the slot lies falloworifthere is a collision, the members of group 1contend for slot 1, etc.By making an appropriate division of stations into groups,the amount of contention for each slot can be reduced, thus operating each slotnear the left end of Fig. 4-9.'),\n",

Wehaveseen such protocols be-fore (e.g., binary countdown). Thenext special case is to assign twostations pergroup. Theprobability that both will try to transmit during a slot isp2,which for asmallpis negligible. Asmore and more stations are assigned to the same slot, theprobability of a collision grows, but the length of the bit-map scan needed to giveeveryone a chance shrinks.The limiting case is a single group containing all sta-tions (i.e., slotted ALOHA).What we need is a way to assign stations to slots dy-namically,with manystations per slot when the load is lowand few(or evenjustone) station per slot when the load is high.The Adaptive Tree-Walk ProtocolOne particularly simple way of performing the necessary assignment is to usethe algorithm devised by the U.S. Army for testing soldiers for syphilis duringWorld War II (Dorfman, 1943).In short, the Army took a blood sample fromNsoldiers. Aportion of each sample was poured into a single test tube.This mixedsample was then tested for antibodies.If none were found, all the soldiers in thegroup were declared healthy. Ifantibodies were present, twonew mixed sampleswere prepared, one from soldiers 1 throughN/2 and one from the rest.The proc-ess was repeated recursively until the infected soldiers were determined.Forthe computerized version of this algorithm (Capetanakis, 1979), it is con-venient to think of the stations as the leavesofabinary tree, as illustrated inFig. 4-10.In the first contention slot following a successful frame transmission,slot 0, all stations are permitted to try to acquire the channel.If one of them does'),\n",

Ifthere is a collision, then during slot 1 only those stations falling undernode 2 in the tree may compete.If one of them acquires the channel, the slot fol-lowing the frame is reserved for those stations under node 3.If, on the other hand,twoormore stations under node 2 want to transmit, there will be a collision duringslot 1, in which case it is node 4’sturn during slot 2.1\\n2 34 5 6 7ABCDEFGHStationsFigure4-10.The tree for eight stations.In essence, if a collision occurs during slot 0, the entire tree is searched, depthfirst, to locate all ready stations.Each bit slot is associated with some particularnode in the tree.If a collision occurs, the search continues recursively with thenode’sleft and right children.If a bit slot is idle or if only one station transmits init, the searching of its node can stop because all ready stations have been located.(Were there more than one, there would have been a collision.)When the load on the system is heavy,itishardly worth the effort to dedicateslot 0 to node 1 because that makes sense only in the unlikely event that preciselyone station has a frame to send.Similarly,one could argue that nodes 2 and 3should be skipped as well for the same reason.Put in more general terms, at whatlevelinthe tree should the search begin? Clearly,the heavier the load, the fartherdown the tree the search should begin. Wewill assume that each station has agood estimate of the number of ready stations,q,for example, from monitoringrecent traffic.To proceed, let us number the levels of the tree from the top, with node 1 inFig. 4-10at level0,nodes 2 and 3 at level1,etc. Noticethat each node at levelihas a fraction 2< iof the stations belowit. Iftheqready stations are uniformly dis-tributed, the expected number of them belowaspecific node at leveliis just 2< iq.Intuitively,wewould expect the optimal leveltobegin searching the tree to be theone at which the mean number of contending stations per slot is 1, that is, the levelat which 2< iq=1. Solving this equation, we find thati=log2q.Numerous improvements to the basic algorithm have been discovered and arediscussed in some detail by Bertsekas and Gallager (1992).It is such a cleveridea'),\n",

Inthis section, we will examine some ofthese protocols.In Sec. 4.4, we will look at 802.11 (WiFi) in detail.Acommon configuration for a wireless LAN is an office building with accesspoints (APs) strategically placed around the building. TheAPs are wired togetherusing copper or fiber and provide connectivity to the stations that talk to them.Ifthe transmission power of the APs and laptops is adjusted to have a range of tens ofmeters, nearby rooms become likeasingle cell and the entire building becomeslikethe cellular telephonysystems we studied in Chap. 2, except that each cellonly has one channel. This channel is shared by all the stations in the cell, includ-ing the AP.Ittypically provides megabits/sec or evengigabits/sec of bandwidth.IEEE 802.11ac can theoretically run at 7 Gbps, but in practice, it is much slower.We havealready remarked that wireless systems cannot normally detect a col-lision while it is occurring.The receivedsignal at a station may be tiny, perhaps amillion times fainter than the signal that is being transmitted.Finding it is likelooking for a ripple on the ocean.Instead, acknowledgements are used to discovercollisions and other errors after the fact.There is an evenmore important difference between wireless LANs and wiredLANs. Astation on a wireless LAN may not be able to transmit frames to or re-ceive frames from all other stations because of the limited radio range of the sta-tions. Inwired LANs, when one station sends a frame, all other stations receive it.The absence of this property in wireless LANs causes a variety of complications.We will makethe simplifying assumption that each radio transmitter has somefixedrange, represented by a circular coverage region within which another stationcan sense and receive the station’stransmission. Itis important to realize that inpractice coverage regions are not nearly so regular because the propagation ofradio signals depends on the environment. Walls and other obstacles that attenuateand reflect signals may cause the range to differ markedly in different directions.But a simple circular model will do for our purposes.Anaive approach to using a wireless LAN might be to try CSMA: just listenfor other transmissions and only transmit if no one else is doing so.The trouble is,'),\n",

IfCsenses the medium, itwill hear a transmission and falsely conclude that it may not send toD(shown as adashed line).In fact, such a transmission would cause bad reception only in thezone betweenBandC,where neither of the intended receivers is located.We wantaMAC protocol that prevents this kind of deferral from happening because itwastes bandwidth.The problem is called theexposed terminal problem.The difficulty is that, before starting a transmission, a station really wants toknowwhether there is radio activity around the receiver. CSMA merely tells itwhether there is activity near the transmitter by sensing the carrier.With a wire, allsignals propagate to all stations, so this distinction does not exist. However, onlyone transmission can then takeplace at once anywhere in the system.In a systembased on short-range radio waves, multiple transmissions can occur simultaneouslyif theyall have different destinations and these destinations are out of range of oneanother.Wewant this concurrencytohappen as the cell gets larger and larger,in'),\n",

Themost important of the survivors are 802.3 (Ethernet) and 802.11 (wire-less LAN). Bluetooth (wireless PAN) is widely deployed but has nowbeen stan-dardized outside of 802.15.We will begin our study of real systems with Ethernet, probably the most ubiq-uitous kind of computer network in the world. Two kinds of Ethernet exist:classicEthernet,which solves the multiple access problem using the techniques we havestudied in this chapter; andswitched Ethernet,inwhich devices calledswitchesare used to connect different computers.It is important to note that, while theyareboth referred to as Ethernet, theyare quite different. Classic Ethernet is the originalform and ran at rates from 3 to 10 Mbps.Switched Ethernet is what Ethernet hasbecome and runs at 100, 1000, 10,000, 40,000, or 100,000 Mbps, in forms calledfast Ethernet, gigabit Ethernet, 10-gigabit Ethernet, 40-gigabit Ethernet, or100-gigabit Ethernet.In practice, only switched Ethernet is used nowadays.We will discuss these historical forms of Ethernet in chronological order show-ing howtheydeveloped. SinceEthernet and IEEE 802.3 are identical except for aminor difference (which we will discuss shortly), manypeople use the terms‘‘Ethernet’’and ‘‘IEEE 802.3’’interchangeably.Wewill do so, too.Formoreinformation about Ethernet, see Spurgeon and Zimmerman (2014).4.3.1 ClassicEthernet Physical LayerThe story of Ethernet starts about the same time as that of ALOHA, when astudent named Bob Metcalfe got his bachelor’sdegree at M.I.T.and then movedupthe rivertoget his Ph.D. at Harvard. Duringhis studies there, he was exposed toAbramson’swork on ALOHA.He became so interested in it that after graduatingfrom Harvard, he decided to spend the summer in Hawaii working with Abramsonbefore starting work at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center).When he got to'),\n",

(Whenthe 19th-centuryBritish physicist James Clerk Maxwell discovered that electromagnetic radiationcould be described by a waveequation, scientists assumed that space must be filledwith some ethereal medium in which the radiation was propagating. Onlyafter thefamous Michelson-Morleyexperiment in 1887 did physicists discoverthat electro-magnetic radiation could propagate in a vacuum.)The Xerox Ethernet was so successful that DEC, Intel, and Xerox drewupastandard in 1978 for a 10-Mbps Ethernet, called theDIX standard.With a minorchange, the DIX standard became the IEEE 802.3 standard in 1983.Unfortunatelyfor Xerox, it already had a history of making seminal inventions (such as the per-sonal computer) and then failing to commercialize on them, a story told inFum-bling the Future(Smith and Alexander,1988). WhenXerox showed no interest indoing anything with Ethernet other than helping standardize it, Metcalfe formedhis own company, 3Com, to sell Ethernet cards for PCs.It sold millions of them.Classic Ethernet snaked around the building as a single long cable to which allthe computers were attached.This architecture is shown in Fig.4-13. Thefirst va-riety,popularly calledthick Ethernet,resembled a yellowgarden hose, withmarkings every 2.5 meters to showwhere to attach computers.(The 802.3 stan-dard did not actuallyrequirethe cable to be yellow, but it didsuggestit.) Itwassucceeded bythin Ethernet,which bent more easily and made connections usingindustry-standard BNC connectors.Thin Ethernet was much cheaper and easier toinstall, but it could run for only 185 meters per segment (instead of 500 m withthick Ethernet), each of which could handle only 30 machines (instead of 100).\\nEtherTransceiver Interfacecable\\nFigure4-13.Architecture of classic Ethernet.Each version of Ethernet has a maximum cable length per segment (i.e., unam-plified length) overwhich the signal will propagate.

Asfarasthe software is concerned, a series of cable segments connectedby repeaters is no different from a single cable (except for a small amount of delayintroduced by the repeaters).Over each of these cables, information was sent using the Manchester en-coding we studied in Sec. 2.4.3.

Sendingto a group of stations is calledmulti-casting.The special address consisting of all 1 bits is reserved forbroadcasting.Aframe containing all 1s in the destination field is accepted by all stations on thenetwork. Multicastingis more selective,but it involves group management todefine which stations are in the group. Conversely,broadcasting does not dif-ferentiate between stations at all, so it does not require anygroup management.'),\n",

Val-ues for this field are assigned by IEEE and indicate a manufacturer.Manufacturersare assigned blocks of 224addresses. The manufacturer assigns the last 3 bytes ofthe address and programs the complete address into the NIC before it is sold.Next comes theTypeorLengthfield, depending on whether the frame is Ether-net or IEEE 802.3.Ethernet uses aTypefield to tell the receiverwhat to do withthe frame.Multiple network-layer protocols may be in use at the same time on thesame machine, so when an Ethernet frame arrives, the operating system has toknowwhich one to hand the frame to.TheTypefield specifies which process togive the frame to.Forexample, a type code of 0x0800 means that the data con-tains an IPv4 packet.IEEE 802.3, in its wisdom, decided that this field would carry the length of theframe, since the Ethernet length was determined by looking inside the data—a lay-ering violation if everthere was one.Of course, this meant there was no way forthe receivertofigure out what to do with an incoming frame.That problem washandled by the addition of another header for the logical link control protocol with-in the data, which we will look at later.Ituses 8 bytes to convey the 2 bytes ofprotocol type information.Unfortunately,bythe time 802.3 was published, so much hardware and soft-ware for DIX Ethernet was already in use that fewmanufacturers and users wereenthusiastic about repackaging theTypeandLengthfields. In1997, IEEE threwinthe towel and said that both ways were fine with it.Fortunately,all theTypefieldsin use before 1997 had values greater than 1500, then well established as the maxi-mum data size.Nowthe rule is that anynumber there less than or equal to 0x600(1536) can be interpreted asLength,and anynumber greater than 0x600 can beinterpreted asType.Now IEEE can maintain that everyone is using its standardand everybody else can keep on doing what theywere already doing (not botheringwith logical link control protocol) without feeling guilty about it.This is whathappens when (industrial) politics meets technology.Next come the data, up to 1500 bytes.This limit was chosen somewhat arbi-trarily at the time the Ethernet standard was cast in stone, mostly based on the factthat a transceiverneeds enough RAM to hold an entire frame and RAM was expen-sive in1978. Alarger upper limit would have meant more RAM, and hence amore expensive transceiver.In addition to there being a maximum frame length, there is also a minimumframe length.While a data field of 0 bytes is sometimes useful, it causes a prob-lem. Whenatransceiverdetects a collision, it truncates the current frame, whichmeans that stray bits and pieces of frames appear on the cable all the time.Tomakeiteasier to distinguish valid frames from garbage, Ethernet requires that valid'),\n",

Thisproblem is illustrated in Fig.4-15. Attime 0, stationA,atone end ofthe network, sends offaframe. Letus call the propagation time for this frame toreach the other endo .Just before the frame gets to the other end (i.e., at timeo < ¡ ), the most distant station,B,starts transmitting.WhenBdetects that it is re-ceiving more power than it is putting out, it knows that a collision has occurred, soit aborts its transmission and generates a 48-bit noise burst to warn all other sta-tions. Inother words, it jams the ether to makesure the sender does not miss thecollision.

This descriptor just means that stations sense the medium when theyhaveaframe to send and send the frame as soon as the medium becomes idle. Theymonitor the channel for collisions as theysend. If there is a collision, theyabort thetransmission with a short jam signal and retransmit after a random interval.Let us nowsee howthe random interval is determined when a collision occurs,as it is a newmethod. Themodel is still that of Fig.4-5. Afteracollision, time isdivided into discrete slots whose length is equal to the worst-case round-trip propa-gation time on the ether (2o ). Toaccommodate the longest path allowed by Ether-net, the slot time has been set to 512 bit times, or 51.2µsec.After the first collision, each station waits either 0 or 1 slot times at random be-fore trying again. Iftwostations collide and each one picks the same random num-ber,theywill collide again. Afterthe second collision, each one picks either 0, 1,2, or 3 at random and waits that number of slot times.If a third collision occurs(the probability of this happening is 0.25), the next time the number of slots to waitis chosen at random from the interval 0 to 23< 1.In general, aftericollisions, a random number between 0 and 2i< 1ischosen,and that number of slots is skipped.However, after 10 collisions have beenreached, the randomization interval is frozen at a maximum of 1023 slots.After 16collisions, the controller throws in the towel and reports failure back to the com-puter.Further recovery is up to higher layers.This algorithm, calledbinary exponential backoff,was chosen to dynam-ically adapt to the number of stations trying to send.If the randomization intervalfor all collisions were 1023, the chance of twostations colliding for a second timewould be negligible, but the average wait after a collision would be hundreds ofslot times, introducing significant delay.Onthe other hand, if each station alwaysdelayed for either 0 or 1 slots, then if 100 stations evertried to send at once theywould collide overand overuntil 99 of them picked 1 and the remaining stationpicked 0.This might takeyears. Byhaving the randomization interval growexpo-nentially as more and more consecutive collisions occur,the algorithm ensures alowdelay when only a fewstations collide but also ensures that the collisions areresolved in a reasonable interval when manystations collide.Truncating the back-offat1023 keeps the bound from growing too large.If there is no collision, the sender assumes that the frame was probably suc-cessfully delivered. That is, neither CSMA/CD nor Ethernet provides acknowl-edgements. This choice is appropriate for wired and optical fiber channels thathave low error rates.

Mostof the resultsshould be taken with a grain (or better yet, a metric ton) of salt, for tworeasons.First, virtually all of the theoretical work assumes Poisson traffic. Whenre-searchers beganlooking at real data, theydiscovered that network trafficisrarelyPoisson. Instead, it is self-similar or bursty overarange of time scales (Paxson andFloyd, 1995; and Fontugne et al., 2017).What this means is that averaging overlong periods of time does not smooth out the traffic. Aswell as using questionablemodels, manyofthe analyses focus on the ‘‘interesting’’performance cases ofabnormally high load. Boggs et al. (1988) showed by experimentation that Ethernetworks well in reality,evenatmoderately high load.4.3.4 SwitchedEthernetEthernet soon begantoevolveawayfrom the single long cable architecture ofclassic Ethernet.The problems associated with finding breaks or loose con-nections drove ittoward a different kind of wiring pattern, in which each stationhas a dedicated cable running to a centralhub.Ahub simply connects all the'),\n",

Thisre-use was a win, but it did reduce the maximum cable run from the hub to 100meters (200 meters if high-quality Category 5 twisted pairs were used).Adding orremoving a station is simpler in this configuration, and cable breaks can be detect-ed easily.With the advantages of being able to use existing wiring and ease ofmaintenance, twisted-pair hubs quickly became the dominant form of Ethernet.However, hubs do not increase capacity because theyare logically equivalentto the single long cable of classic Ethernet.As more and more stations are added,each station gets a decreasing share of the fixed capacity.Eventually,the LAN willsaturate. Onewayout is to go to a higher speed, say,from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps,1Gbps, or evenhigher speeds.But with the growth of multimedia and powerfulservers, evena1-Gbps Ethernet can become saturated.Fortunately,there is an another way to deal with increased load: switchedEthernet. Theheart of this system is aswitchcontaining a high-speed backplanethat connects all of the ports, as shown in Fig.4-17(b). Fromthe outside, a switchlooks just likeahub.Theyare both boxes, typically with 4 to 48 ports, each with astandard RJ-45 connector for a twisted-pair cable.Each cable connects the switchor hub to a single computer,asshown in Fig.4-18. Aswitch has the same advan-tages as a hub, too. It is easy to add or remove a new station by plugging orunplugging a wire, and it is easy to find most faults since a flakycable or port willusually affect just one station. There is still a shared component that can fail—theswitch itself—but if all stations lose connectivity the IT folks knowwhat to do tofixthe problem: replace the whole switch.Inside the switch, however, something very different is happening.Switchesonly output frames to the ports for which those frames are destined.When aswitch port receivesanEthernet frame from a station, the switch checks the Ether-net addresses to see which port the frame is destined for.This step requires the'),\n",

For now, just assume that the switch knows the frame’sdestination port.The switch then forwards the frame overits high-speed backplaneto the destination port. The backplane typically runs at manyGbps, using a propri-etary protocol that does not need to be standardized because it is entirely hiddeninside the switch.The destination port then transmits the frame on the wire so thatit reaches the intended station. None of the other ports evenknows the frameexists.What happens if more than one of the stations or ports wants to send a frame atthe same time? Again, switches differ from hubs.In a hub, all stations are in thesamecollision domain.Theymust use the CSMA/CD algorithm to schedule theirtransmissions. Inaswitch, each port is its own independent collision domain.Inthe common case that the cable is full duplex, both the station and the port cansend a frame on the cable at the same time, without worrying about other ports andstations. Collisionsare nowimpossible and CSMA/CD is not needed.However, ifthe cable is half duplex, the station and the port must contend for transmission withCSMA/CD in the usual way.Aswitch improvesperformance overahub in twoways. First, since there areno collisions, the capacity is used more efficiently.Second, and more importantly,with a switch multiple frames can be sent simultaneously (by different stations).These frames will reach the switch ports and traveloverthe switch’sbackplane tobe output on the proper ports. However, since twoframes might be sent to the sameoutput port at the same time, the switch must have buffering so that it can tempo-rarily queue an input frame until it can be transmitted to the output port.Overall,these improvements give a large performance win that is not possible with a hub.The total system throughput can often be increased by an order of magnitude, de-pending on the number of ports and trafficpatterns.The change in the ports on which frames are output also has security benefits.Most LAN interfaces have apromiscuous mode,inwhichallframes are giventoeach computer,not just those addressed to it.With a hub, every computer that isattached can see the trafficsent between all of the other computers.Spies andbusybodies love this feature.With a switch, trafficisforwarded only to the ports'),\n",

Successfulframes makeitthrough the hub to theswitch and are treated there likeany other incoming frames.The switch does notknowtheyhad to fight their way in.Once in the switch, theyare sent to the correctoutput line overthe high-speed backplane.It is possible that the correct destina-tion was one on the lines attached to the hub, in which case the frame has alreadybeen delivered so the switch drops it.Hubs are simpler and cheaper than switches,butdue to falling switch prices, theyhavebecome an endangered species.Modernnetworks largely use switched Ethernet.Nevertheless, legacy hubs still exist.4.3.5 Fast EthernetAt the same time that switches were becoming popular,the speed of 10-MbpsEthernet was coming under pressure.At first, 10 Mbps seemed likeheaven, just ascable modems seemed likeheaventothe users of 56-kbps telephone modems.Butthe novelty wore offquickly.Asakind of corollary to Parkinson’sLaw (‘‘Workexpands to fill the time available for its completion’’), it seemed that data expandedto fill the bandwidth available for their transmission.Manyinstallations needed more bandwidth and thus had numerous 10-MbpsLANs connected by a maze of repeaters, hubs, and switches, although to the net-work managers it sometimes felt that theywere being held together by bubble gumand chicken wire. But evenwith Ethernet switches, the maximum bandwidth of asingle computer was limited by the cable that connected it to the switch port.It was in this environment that IEEE reconvened the 802.3 committee in 1992with instructions to come up with a faster LAN.One proposal was to keep 802.3exactly as it was, but just makeitgofaster.Another proposal was to redo it totallyand give itlots of newfeatures, such as real-time trafficand digitized voice, butjust keep the old name (for marketing reasons).After some wrangling, the com-mittee decided to keep 802.3 the way it was, and just makeitgofaster.This strate-gy would get the job done before the technology changed and avoid unforeseenproblems with a brand newdesign. The newdesign would also be backward-com-patible with existing Ethernet LANs.The people behind the losing proposal didwhat anyself-respecting computer-industry people would have done under thesecircumstances: theystomped offand formed their own committee and standardizedtheir LAN anyway (eventually as 802.12).It flopped miserably.The work was done quickly (by standards committees’ norms), and the result,802.3u, was approvedbyIEEE in June 1995.Technically,802.3u is not really a'),\n",

However, the advantages of twisted-pair wiring were so overwhelming thatfast Ethernet is based entirely on this design.Thus, all fast Ethernet systems usehubs and switches; multidrop cables with vampire taps or BNC connectors are notpermitted.Nevertheless, some choices still had to be made, the most important beingwhich wire types to support.One contender was Category 3 twisted pair.The arg-ument for it was that practically every office in the Western world had at least fourCategory 3 (or better) twisted pairs running from it to a telephone wiring closetwithin 100 meters.Sometimes twosuch cables existed. Thus,using Category 3twisted pair would makeitpossible to wire up desktop computers using fast Ether-net without having to rewire the building, an enormous advantage for manyorgani-zations.The main disadvantage of a Category 3 twisted pair is its inability to carry 100Mbps over100 meters, the maximum computer-to-hub distance specified for10-Mbps hubs.In contrast, Category 5 twisted pair wiring can handle 100 m easi-ly,and fiber can go much farther.The compromise chosen was to allowall threepossibilities, as shown in Fig.4-19, but to pep up the Category 3 solution to give itthe additional carrying capacity needed.Name Cable Max.segment Advantages100Base-T4 Twisted pair100 mUses category3UTP100Base-TX Twisted pair100 mFull duplexat100 Mbps (Cat 5 UTP)100Base-FX Fiberoptics 2000mFull duplexat100 Mbps; long runsFigure4-19.The original fast Ethernet cabling.The Category 3 UTP scheme, formally called100Base-T4,used a signalingspeed of 25 MHz, only 25% faster than standard Ethernet’s20MHz. (Rememberthat Manchester encoding, discussed in Sec. 2.4.3, requires twoclock periods foreach of the 10 million bits sent each second.)However, toachieve the necessarybit rate, 100Base-T4 requires four twisted pairs.Of the four pairs, one is always tothe hub, one is always from the hub, and the other twoare switchable to the currenttransmission direction.To get 100 Mbps out of the three twisted pairs in the trans-mission direction, a fairly involved scheme is used on each twisted pair.Itinvolvessending ternary digits with three different voltage levels.

Instead, the4B/5Bencoding we described in Sec 2.4.3 is used.Four data bits are encoded as 5signal bits and sent at 125 MHz to provide 100 Mbps. This scheme is simple buthas sufficient transitions for synchronization and uses the bandwidth of the wirerelatively well.The 100Base-TX system is full duplex; stations can transmit at100 Mbps on one twisted pair and receive at100 Mbps on another twisted pair atthe same time.The last option,100Base-FX,uses twostrands of multimode fiber,one foreach direction, so it, too, can run full duplexwith 100 Mbps in each direction.Inthis setup, the distance between a station and the switch can be up to 2 km.Fast Ethernet allows interconnection by either hubs or switches.To ensure thatthe CSMA/CD algorithm continues to work, the relationship between the mini-mum frame size and maximum cable length must be maintained as the networkspeed goes up from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps. So, either the minimum frame size of64 bytes must go up or the maximum cable length of 2500 m must come down,proportionally.The easy choice was for the maximum distance between anytwostations to come down by a factor of 10, since a hub with 100-m cables falls withinthis newmaximum already.However, 2-km 100Base-FX cables are too long topermit a 100-Mbps hub with the normal Ethernet collision algorithm. These cablesmust instead be connected to a switch and operate in a full-duplexmode so thatthere are no collisions.Users quickly started to deployfast Ethernet, but theywere not about to throwaway10-Mbps Ethernet cards on older computers. As a consequence, virtually allfast Ethernet switches can handle a mix of 10-Mbps and 100-Mbps stations.Tomakeupgrading easy,the standard itself provides a mechanism calledauto-negoti-ationthat lets twostations automatically negotiate the optimum speed (10 or 100Mbps) and duplexity (half or full).It works well most of the time but is known tolead to duplexmismatch problems when one end of the link autonegotiates but theother end does not and is set to full-duplexmode (Shalunovand Carlson, 2005).Most Ethernet products use this feature to configure themselves.4.3.6 GigabitEthernetThe ink was barely dry on the fast Ethernet standard when the 802 committeebeganworking on a yet faster Ethernet, quickly dubbedgigabit Ethernet.IEEEratified the most popular form as 802.3ab in 1999.Below, wewill discuss some of'),\n",

Inthe simplest configuration, illustrated in Fig.4-20(a), twocomputers aredirectly connected to each other.The more common case, however, uses a switchor a hub connected to multiple computers and possibly additional switches or hubs,as shown in Fig.4-20(b). Inboth configurations, each individual Ethernet cablehas exactly twodevices on it, no more and no fewer. Switch or hub\\nEthernet(b)(a)\\nEthernetComputer\\nFigure4-20.(a) A two-station Ethernet.

The‘‘normal’’mode is full-duplexmode, which allows trafficinboth directions at the same time.This mode is usedwhen there is a central switch connected to computers (or other switches) on theperiphery.Inthis configuration, all lines are buffered so each computer and switchis free to send frames wheneveritwants to.The sender does not have tosense thechannel to see if anybody else is using it because contention is impossible.On theline between a computer and a switch, the computer is the only possible sender tothe switch, and the transmission will succeed evenifthe switch is currently send-ing a frame to the computer (because the line is full duplex). Sinceno contentionis possible, the CSMA/CD protocol is not used, so the maximum length of thecable is determined by signal strength issues rather than by howlong it takes for anoise burst to propagate back to the sender in the worst case.Switches are free tomix and match speeds.Autonegotiation is supported just as in fast Ethernet, onlynowthe choice is among 10, 100, and 1000 Mbps.'),\n",

Thefirst feature, calledcarrier extension,essentiallytells the hardware to add its own padding after the normal frame to extend theframe to 512 bytes.Since this padding is added by the sending hardware and re-movedbythe receiving hardware, the software is unaware of it, meaning that nochanges are needed to existing software. Thedownside is that using 512 bytesworth of bandwidth to transmit 46 bytes of user data (the payload of a 64-byteframe) has a line efficiencyofonly 9%.The second feature, calledframe bursting,allows a sender to transmit a con-catenated sequence of multiple frames in a single transmission.If the total burst isless than 512 bytes, the hardware pads it again. Ifenough frames are waiting fortransmission, this scheme is very efficient and preferred overcarrier extension.In all fairness, it is hard to imagine an organization buying modern computerswith gigabit Ethernet cards and then connecting them with an old-fashioned hub tosimulate classic Ethernet with all its collisions.Gigabit Ethernet interfaces andswitches used to be expensive,but their prices fell rapidly as sales volumes pickedup. Still,backward compatibility is sacred in the computer industry,sothe com-mittee was required to put it in.Today,most computers ship with an Ethernet in-terface that is capable of 10-, 100-, and 1000-Mbps operation (and maybe higher)and compatible with all of them.Gigabit Ethernet supports both copper and fiber cabling, as listed in Fig.4-21.Signaling at or near 1 Gbps requires encoding and sending a bit every nanosecond.This trick was initially accomplished with short, shielded copper cables (the1000Base-CX version) and optical fibers. For the optical fibers, twowavelengthsare permitted and result in twodifferent versions: 0.85 microns (short, for1000Base-SX) and 1.3 microns (long, for 1000Base-LX).Signaling at the short wavelength can be achievedwith cheap LEDs. It is usedwith multimode fiber and is useful for connections within a building, as it can runup to 500 m for 50-micron fiber.Signaling at the long wavelength requires lasers.On the other hand, when combined with single-mode (10-micron) fiber,the cablecan be up to 5 km. This limit allows long distance connections between buildings,'),\n",

Peopleapparently dislikerewiring their buildings.More complicated signaling is needed to makeEthernet run at 1000 Mbps overCategory 5 wires.To start, all four twisted pairs in the cable are used, and eachpair is used in both directions at the same time by using digital signal processing toseparate signals.Over each wire, fivevoltage levels that carry 2 bits are used forsignaling at 125 Msymbols/sec. The mapping to produce the symbols from the bitsis not straightforward. Itinvolves scrambling, for transitions, followed by an errorcorrecting code in which four values are embedded into fivesignal levels.Aspeed of 1 Gbps is quite fast. For example, if a receiverisbusy with someother task for even1msec and does not empty the input buffer on some line, up to1953 frames may have accumulated in that gap. Also,when a computer on a giga-bit Ethernet is shipping data down the line to a computer on a classic Ethernet,buffer overruns are very likely.Asaconsequence of these twoobservations, giga-bit Ethernet supports flowcontrol. The mechanism consists of one end sending aspecial control frame to the other end telling it to pause for some period of time.ThesePA USEcontrol frames are normal Ethernet frames containing a type of0x8808. Pauses are giveninunits of the minimum frame time.Forgigabit Ether-net, the time unit is 512 nsec, allowing for pauses as long as 33.6 msec.There is one more extension that was introduced along with gigabit Ethernet.Jumbo framesallowfor frames to be longer than 1500 bytes, usually up to 9 KB.'),\n",

IEEEtold them to start on 10-gigabit Ethernet.This work followed much the same pattern as the previous Ethernet standards, withstandards for fiber and shielded copper cable appearing first in 2002 and 2004, fol-lowed by the standard for copper twisted pair in 2006.TenGbps is an impressive speed, 1000x faster than the original Ethernet.Where could it be needed?The answer is inside data centers and exchanges toconnect high-end routers, switches, and servers, as well as in long-distance, highbandwidth trunks between offices that are enabling entire metropolitan area net-works based on Ethernet and fiber.The long distance connections use optical fiber,while the short connections may use copper or fiber.All versions of 10-gigabit Ethernet support only full-duplexoperation.CSMA/CD is no longer part of the design, and the standards concentrate on the de-tails of physical layers that can run at very high speed. Compatibility still matters,though, so 10-gigabit Ethernet interfaces autonegotiate and fall back to the highestspeed supported by both ends of the line.The main kinds of 10-gigabit Ethernet are listed in Fig.4-22. Multimodefiberwith the 0.85µ(short) wavelength is used for medium distances, and single-modefiber at 1.3µ(long) and 1.5µ(extended) is used for long distances.10GBase-ERcan run for distances of 40 km, making it suitable for wide area applications. All ofthese versions send a serial stream of information that is produced by scramblingthe data bits, then encoding them with a64B/66Bcode.

Each pair uses 8B/10B coding and runs at 3.125 Gsymb-ols/sec to reach 10 Gbps. This version is cheaper than fiber and was early to mar-ket, but it remains to be seen whether it will be beat out in the long run by 10-giga-bit Ethernet overmore garden-variety twisted-pair wiring.10GBase-T is the version that uses UTP cables. While it calls for Category 6awiring, for shorter runs, it can use lower categories (including Category 5) to allowsome reuse of installed cabling.Not surprisingly,the physical layer is quite invol-vedtoreach 10 Gbps overtwisted pair.Wewill only sketch some of the high-leveldetails. Each of the four twisted pairs is used to send 2500 Mbps in both directions.This speed is reached using a signaling rate of 800 Msymbols/sec with symbolsthat use 16 voltage levels. The symbols are produced by scrambling the data, pro-tecting it with a LDPC (LowDensity Parity Check) code, and further coding forerror correction.Ten-gigabit Ethernet is nowwidespread in the market, so the 802.3 committeehas movedon. At the end of 2007, IEEE created a group to standardize Ethernetoperating at 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps. This upgrade will let Ethernet compete in veryhigh-performance settings, including long-distance connections in backbone net-works and short connections overthe equipment backplanes. The standard is notyet complete, but proprietary products are already available.4.3.8 40-and 100-Gigabit EthernetAfter it finished standardizing 10-gigabit Ethernet, the 802.11 committee gotto work on newstandards for Ethernet at 40 gigabits/sec and 100 gigabits/sec. Theformer is targeted at internal connections in data centers, not at ordinary officesand certainly not end users.The latter is targeted at the Internet backbone and assuch has to work on optical-network runs of thousands of kilometers.Apossibleuse is a virtual private LAN to connect a data center with a million CPUs to anoth-er million-CPU data center.The first standard was 802.3ba, approvedin2010, followed by 802.3bj (2014)and 802.3cd (2018).All of these define Ethernet at both 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps.Design goals included:1. Backward compatibility with 802.3 standards to 1 gigabit/sec.2. Allowing the minimum and maximum frame sizes to stay the same.3. Handlebit-error rates of 10< 12and better.4.

The standards are 802.3cd, 802.3ck, 802.3cm,and 802.3cn if you want to look them up.At 400 Gbps, a typical (compressed) 4Kmovie can be downloaded in full in about 2 seconds.4.3.9 Retrospective onEthernetEthernet has been around for over40years and has no serious competitors insight, so it is likely to be around for manymore years to come.FewCPU architec-tures, operating systems, or programming languages have been king of the moun-tain for three decades going on strong.Clearly,Ethernet did something right.What was it?Probably the main reason for its longevity is that Ethernet is simple and flexi-ble. Inpractice, simple translates into reliable, cheap, and easy to maintain.Oncethe hub and switch architecture was adopted, failures became extremely rare.Peo-ple hesitate to replace something that works perfectly all the time, especially whentheyknowthat an awful lot of things in the computer industry work very poorly,sothat manyso-called ‘‘upgrades’’are worse than what theyreplaced.Simple also translates into cheap. Twisted-pair wiring is relatively inexpensiveas are the hardware components. Theymay start out expensive when there is atransition, for example, newgigabit Ethernet NICs or switches, but theyare merelyadditions to a well-established network (not a replacement of it) and the prices fallquickly as the sales volume picks up.Ethernet is easy to maintain.There is no software to install (other than thedrivers) and not much in the way of configuration tables to manage (and getwrong). Also,adding newhosts is as simple as just plugging them in.Another point is that Ethernet interworks easily with TCP/IP,which has be-come dominant.IP is a connectionless protocol, so it fits perfectly with Ethernet,which is also connectionless.IP fits much less well with connection-oriented alter-nativessuch as ATM. This mismatch definitely hurt ATM’schances.Lastly,and perhaps most importantly,Ethernet has been able to evolveincer-tain crucial ways.

Neither one made it.Theyweretoo complicated, which led to complexchips and high prices. The lesson thatshould have been learned here was KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).Eventually,Ethernet caught up with them in terms of speed, often by borrowing some of theirtechnology,for example, the 4B/5B coding from FDDI and the 8B/10B codingfrom Fibre Channel.Then, theyhad no advantages left and quietly died offorfellinto specialized roles.It looks likeEthernet will continue to expand in its applications for some time.Ten-gigabit Ethernet freed it from the distance constraints of CSMA/CD.Mucheffort is being put intocarrier-grade Ethernetto let network providers offerEthernet-based services to their customers for metropolitan and wide area networks(Hawkins, 2016).This application carries Ethernet frames long distances overfiber and calls for better management features to help operators offer reliable,high-quality services.Very high-speed networks like100GbE are also finding usesin backplanes connecting components in large routers or servers. Bothof theseuses are in addition to that of sending frames between computers in offices.

Wireless LANs canalso be used to let twoormore nearby computers communicate without using theInternet.The main wireless LAN standard for overtwo decades has been 802.11.Wegave some background information on it in Sec. 1.5.3.

All the 802 protocols, including 802.11 andEthernet, have a certain commonality of structure.Apartial viewofthe 802.11protocol stack for the major 802.11 variants is giveninFig. 4-24.The stack is thesame for clients and APs.The physical layer corresponds fairly well to the OSIphysical layer,but the data link layer in all the 802 protocols is split into twoormore sublayers.In 802.11, the MACsublayer determines howthe channel is allo-cated, that is, who gets to transmit next.

The first is called 802.11aand uses a different frequencyband, 5 GHz. The second stuck with 2.4 GHz andcompatibility.Itiscalled 802.11g.Both give rates up to 54 Mbps.Transmission techniques that simultaneously use multiple antennas at thetransmitter and receiverfor a speed boost were finalized as 802.11n in Oct. 2009.In December of 2013, IEEE ran out of letters and published the next standardas 802.11ac.As an aside, the 802.11 committee members knowthe whole alpha-bet and use the ‘‘missing’’letters, such as 802.11r,for minor technical refinementsand amendments (often for clarifications and bug fixes). 802.11acoperates in the5-GHz band, which means that older devices that use only the 2.4 GHz band can-not use it.Most modern mobile devices use 802.11ac.Most recently,the 802.11axstandard was approvedfor evenmore speed.We will nowexamine each of these transmission techniques briefly.Wewillonly coverthose that are in use, however, skipping the legacy 802.11 transmissionmethods.

Thesebands have the advantageof being unlicensed and hence freely available to anytransmitter willing to meetsome restrictions, such as radiated power of at most 1 W (though 50 mW is moretypical for wireless LAN radios).Unfortunately,this fact is also known to themanufacturers of garage door openers, cordless phones, microwave ovens, andcountless other devices, all of which compete with laptops and smartphones usingWiFi for the same spectrum.The 2.4-GHz band tends to be more crowded than the5-GHz band, so 5 GHz can be better for some applications eventhough it hasshorter range due to the higher frequency. Unfortunately,the shorter radio wavesat 5 GHz do not penetrate walls as well as the longer ones at 2.4 GHz do, so 5 GHzis not the unquestioned champion.All of the transmission methods also define multiple rates.The idea is that dif-ferent rates can be used depending on the current conditions. If the wireless signalis weak, a lowrate can be used. If the signal is clear,the highest rate can be used.This adjustment is calledrate adaptation.Since the rates vary by a factor of 10 ormore, good rate adaptation is important for good performance. Of course, since itis not needed for interoperability,the standards do not say howrate adaptationshould be done.The first transmission method we shall look at is802.11b.Itisaspread-spec-trum method that supports rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps, though in practice theoperating rate is nearly always 11 Mbps.It is similar to the CDMA system we ex-amined in Sec. 2.4.4, except that there is only one spreading code that is shared byall users. Spreading is used to satisfy the FCC requirement that power be spreadoverthe ISM band.The spreading sequence used by 802.11b is called aBarkersequence.Ithas the property that its autocorrelation is lowexcept when the se-quences are aligned. This property allows a receivertolock onto the start of atransmission. Tosend at a rate of 1 Mbps, the Barker sequence is used with BPSKmodulation to send 1 bit per 11 chips.The chips are transmitted at a rate of 11Mchips/sec. Tosend at 2 Mbps, it is used with QPSK modulation to send 2 bitsper 11 chips.The higher rates are different. Theserates use a technique calledCCK(Complementary Code Keying)toconstruct codes instead of the Barker se-quence. The5.5-Mbps rate sends 4 bits in every 8-chip code, and the 11-Mbps ratesends 8 bits in every 8-chip code.Next, we come to802.11a,which supports rates up to 54 Mbps in the 5-GHzISM band.Youmight have expected that 802.11a to come before 802.11b, but thatwasnot the case. Although the 802.11a group was set up first, the 802.11b stan-dard was approvedfirst and its product got to market well ahead of the 802.11aproducts, partly because of the difficulty of operating in the higher 5-GHz band.The 802.11a method is based onOFDM(Orthogonal Frequency DivisionMultiplexing)because OFDM uses the spectrum efficiently and resists wireless'),\n",

With dif-ferent combinations, 802.11a can run at eight different rates, ranging from 6 to 54Mbps. Theserates are significantly faster than 802.11b rates, and there is less in-terference in the 5-GHz band. However, 802.11b has a range that is about seventimes greater than that of 802.11a, which is more important in manysituations.Even with the greater range, the 802.11b people had no intention of letting thisupstart win the speed championship.Fortunately,inMay 2002, the FCC droppedits long-standing rule requiring all wireless communications equipment operatingin the ISM bands in the U.S. to use spread spectrum, so it got to work on802.11g,which was approvedbyIEEE in 2003.It copies the OFDM modulation methodsof 802.11a but operates in the narrow2.4-GHz ISM band along with 802.11b.Itoffers the same rates as 802.11a (6 to 54 Mbps) plus of course compatibility withany802.11b devices that happen to be nearby.All of these different choices can beconfusing for customers, so it is common for products to support 802.11a/b/g in asingle network interface card.Not content to stop there, the IEEE committee beganwork on a high-through-put physical layer called802.11n.Itwas ratified in 2009.The goal for 802.11nwasthroughput of at least 100 Mbps after all the wireless overheads were removed.This goal called for a rawspeed increase of at least a factor of four.Tomakeithappen, the committee doubled the channels from 20 MHz to 40 MHz and reducedframing overheads by allowing a group of frames to be sent together.More signifi-cantly,however, 802.11n uses up to four antennas to transmit up to four streams ofinformation at the same time. The signals of the streams interfere at the receiver,buttheycan be separated usingMIMO(Multiple Input Multiple Output)com-munications techniques.The use of multiple antennas givesalarge speed boost, orbetter range and reliability instead.MIMO, likeOFDM, is one of those clevercommunications ideas that is changing wireless designs and which we are all likelyto hear a lot about in the future.Forabrief introduction to multiple antennas in802.11, see Halperin et al. (2010).In 2013, IEEE published the 802.11ac standard.It uses wider (80 MHz and160 MHz) channels, 256-QAM modulation, andMU-MIMO(MultiUser MIMO)with up to eight streams and other tricks to crank the bit rate up to a theoreticalmaximum of 7 Gbps, although in practice this is virtually neverevenapproached.Modern consumer mobile devices generally use 802.11ac.Another recent 802.11 standard is802.11ad.This one operates in the 60 GHzband (57–71 GHz), which means the radio wavesare very short: only 5 mm long.These wavesdonot penetrate walls or anything else, so the standard is only usefulwithin a single room.

You might get 1 Gbps, though.In 802.11ax OFDMA, a central scheduler allocates fixed-length resource unitsto each of the transmitting stations, thus reducing contention in dense deployments.802.11ax also provides support for spatial spectrum reuse, through a techniquecalledcoloring,whereby a sender marks the beginning of its transmission in suchaway that allows other senders to determine whether simultaneous use of the spec-trum could takeplace. In some circumstances, a sender could transmit simultan-eously if it reduces its power accordingly.Additionally,802.11ax uses 1024-QAM, which allows each symbol to encode10 bits, as opposed to the 8 bits/symbol in 256-QAM that 802.11ac uses.The stan-dard also supports smarter scheduling through a feature calledtarget waketime,which allows a router to put devices in the home on transmission schedules to min-imize collisions. This feature is likely to be most useful in smart homes, where anincreasing number of connected devices may need to periodically send heartbeatsto the home router.4.4.3 The802.11 MACSublayer ProtocolLet us nowreturn from the land of electrical engineering to the land of com-puter science.The 802.11 MACsublayer protocol is quite different from that ofEthernet, due to twofactors that are fundamental to wireless communication.First, radios are nearly always half duplex, meaning that theycannot transmitand listen for noise bursts at the same time on a single frequency. The receivedsignal can easily be a million times weaker than the transmitted signal, so it cannotbe heard at the same time.With Ethernet, a station just waits until the ether goessilent and then starts transmitting.If it does not receive a noise burst back whiletransmitting the first 64 bytes, the frame has almost assuredly been delivered cor-rectly.With wireless, this collision detection mechanism does not work.Instead, 802.11 tries to avoid collisions with a protocol calledCSMA/CA(CSMA with Collision Avoidance). Thisprotocol is conceptually similar toEthernet’sCSMA/CD, with channel sensing before sending and exponential back'),\n",

However, a station that has a frame to send starts with a randombackoff(except in the case that it has not used the channel recently and the channelis idle). It does not wait for a collision.The number of slots to backoffischosen inthe range 0 to, say,15inthe case of the OFDM physical layer.The station waitsuntil the channel is idle, by sensing that there is no signal for a short period of time(called the DIFS, as we explain below), and counts down idle slots, pausing whenframes are sent.It sends its frame when the counter reaches 0.If the frame getsthrough, the destination immediately sends a short acknowledgement. Lackof anacknowledgement is inferred to indicate an error,whether a collision or otherwise.In this case, the sender doubles the backoffperiod and tries again, continuing withexponential backoffasinEthernet until the frame has been successfully trans-mitted or the maximum number of retransmissions has been reached.An example timeline is shown in Fig.4-25. StationAis the first to send aframe. WhileAis sending, stationsBandCbecome ready to send. Theysee thatthe channel is busy and wait for it to become idle.

First,starting backoffsearly helps to avoid collisions. This avoidance is worthwhile because collisions areexpensive,asthe entire frame is transmitted evenifone occurs. Second, acknowl-edgements are used to infer collisions because collisions cannot be detected.This mode of operation is calledDCF(Distributed Coordination Function)because each station acts independently,without anykind of central control.Thestandard also includes an optional additional mode of operation calledPCF(Point'),\n",

With a wire, the system is engineered so that all stations can hear eachother.With the complexities of RF propagation, this situation does not hold forwireless stations.Consequently,situations such as the hidden terminal problemmentioned earlier and illustrated again in Fig.4-26(a) can arise.Since not all sta-tions are within radio range of each other,transmissions going on in one part of acell may not be receivedelsewhere in the same cell.In this example, stationCistransmitting to stationB.IfAsenses the channel, it will not hear anything and willfalsely conclude that it may nowstart transmitting toB.This decision leads to acollision.\\nRangeof C'sradioA CB\\n(a)\\nA C\\nRangeof A'sradioB\\n(b)\\nA wants to send to Bbut cannot hear thatB is busy B wants to send to Cbut mistakenly thinksthe transmission will fail\\nC is transmittingA is transmitting\\nFigure4-26.(a) The hidden terminal problem.

Thisdecision wastes a transmissionopportunity.To reduce ambiguities about which station is sending, 802.11 defines channelsensing to consist of both physical sensing and virtual sensing. Physical sensingsimply checks the medium to see if there is a valid signal.With virtual sensing,each station keeps a logical record of when the channel is in use by tracking theNAV(Network Allocation Vector). Eachframe carries aNAVfield that says howlong the sequence of which this frame is part will taketocomplete. Stations thatoverhear this frame knowthat the channel will be busy for the period indicated bytheNAV,regardless of whether theycan sense a physical signal.Forexample, the\"),\n",

Allstations that hear the data frame will defer during the acknowledgement period,whether or not theycan hear the acknowledgement. Essentially,the NAV serveslikeacountdown timer,during which period the sender assumes that the channel isbusy.In802.11, the units of the NAV are microseconds. In dense deployments, theNAVset by one sender can be reset by other senders in the same transmissionrange, thus causing collisions and suboptimal performance. Tomitigate this effect,802.11ax introduces twoNAVs; one NAV ismodified by frames corresponding toframes that the station is associated with, and the second NAV ismodified byframes that are heard by the station but originate in overlapping networks.An optionalRTS/CTSmechanism uses theNAVto prevent terminals from send-ing frames at the same time as hidden terminals.It is shown in Fig.4-27.

Itdoes not help for short frames (which are sent in place of theRTS)orfor the AP (which everyone can hear,bydefinition). For other situations, it onlyslows down operation.RTS/CTSin 802.11 is a little different than in the MACAprotocol we sawinSec 4.2 because everyone hearing theRTSorCTSremains quietfor the duration to allowtheACKto get through without collision.Because of this,it does not help with exposed terminals as MACA did, only with hidden terminals.Most often there are fewhidden terminals, and CSMA/CA already helps them byslowing down stations that transmit unsuccessfully,whateverthe cause, to makeitmore likely that transmissions will succeed.CSMA/CA with physical and virtual sensing is the core of the 802.11 protocol.However, there are several other mechanisms that have been developed to go withit. Each of these mechanisms was drivenbythe needs of real operation, so we willlook at them briefly.The first need we will takealook at is reliability.Incontrast to wired net-works, wireless networks are noisy and unreliable, in no small part due to inter-ference from other kinds of devices, such as microwave ovens, which also use theunlicensed ISM bands.The use of acknowledgements and retransmissions is of lit-tle help if the probability of getting a frame through is small in the first place.The main strategy that is used to increase successful transmissions is to lowerthe transmission rate. Slower rates use more robust modulations that are more like-ly to be receivedcorrectly for a givensignal-to-noise ratio.If too manyframes arelost, a station can lower the rate.If frames are delivered with little loss, a stationcan occasionally test a higher rate to see if it should be used.Another strategy to improve the chance of the frame getting through undam-aged is to send shorter frames.If the probability of anybit being in error isp,theprobability of ann-bit frame being receivedentirely correctly is (1< p)n.For ex-ample, forp=10< 4,the probability of receiving a full Ethernet frame (12,144 bits)correctly is less than 30%.Most frames will be lost. But if the frames are only athird as long (4048 bits), twothirds of them will be receivedcorrectly.Now mostframes will get through and fewer retransmissions will be needed.Shorter frames can be implemented by reducing the maximum size of the mes-sage that is accepted from the network layer.Alternatively,802.11 allows framesto be split into smaller pieces, calledfragments,each with its own checksum.Thefragment size is not fixed by the standard, but is a parameter that can be adjustedby the AP.The fragments are individually numbered and acknowledged using astop-and-wait protocol (i.e., the sender may not transmit fragmentk+1until it hasreceivedthe acknowledgement for fragmentk). Oncethe channel has been ac-quired, multiple fragments are sent as a burst. Theygoone after the other with anacknowledgement (and possibly retransmissions) in between, until either the wholeframe has been successfully sent or the transmission time reaches the maximum al-lowed. TheNAVmechanism described above keeps other stations quiet only until'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 342}, page_content='SEC. 4.4 WIRELESS LANS 319the next acknowledgement, but another mechanism (see below) is used to allowaburst of fragments to be sent without other stations sending a frame in the middle.The second need we will discuss is saving power.Battery life is always anissue with mobile wireless devices. The802.11 standard pays attention to the issueof power management so that clients need not waste power when theyhaveneitherinformation to send nor to receive.The basic mechanism for saving power builds onbeacon frames.Beacons areperiodic broadcasts by the AP (e.g., every 100 msec).The frames advertise thepresence of the AP to clients and carry system parameters, such as the identifier ofthe AP,the time, howlong until the next beacon, and security settings.Clients can set a power-management bit in frames that theysend to the AP totell it that theyare enteringpower-save mode.Inthis mode, the client can dozeand the AP will buffer trafficintended for it. Tocheck for incoming traffic, the cli-ent wakes up for every beacon, and checks a trafficmap that is sent as part of thebeacon. This map tells the client if there is buffered traffic. If so, the client sends apoll message to the AP,which then sends the buffered traffic. Theclient can thengo back to sleep until the next beacon is sent.Another power-saving mechanism, calledAPSD(Automatic Power SaveDelivery), was added to 802.11 in 2005.With this newmechanism, the AP buffersframes and sends them to a client just after the client sends frames to the AP.Theclient can then go to sleep until it has more traffictosend (and receive). Thismechanism works well for applications such as VoIP that have frequent trafficinboth directions.Forexample, a VoIP wireless phone might use it to send and re-ceive frames every 20 msec, much more frequently than the beacon interval of 100msec, while dozing in between.The third and last need we will examine is quality of service.When the VoIPtrafficinthe preceding example competes with peer-to-peer traffic, the VoIP trafficwill suffer.Itwill be delayed due to contention with the high-bandwidth peer-to-peer traffic, eventhough the VoIP bandwidth is low. These delays are likely todegrade the voice calls.To prevent this degradation, we would liketolet the VoIPtrafficgoahead of the peer-to-peer traffic, as it is of higher priority.IEEE 802.11 has a clevermechanism to provide this kind of quality of servicethat was introduced as set of extensions under the name 802.11e in 2005.It worksby extending CSMA/CA with carefully defined intervals between frames.After aframe has been sent, a certain amount of idle time is required before anystationmay send a frame to check that the channel is no longer in use.The trick is todefine different time intervals for different kinds of frames.Five intervals are depicted in Fig.4-28. Theinterval between regular dataframes is called theDIFS(DCF InterFrame Spacing). Anystation may attemptto acquire the channel to send a newframe after the medium has been idle forDIFS. Theusual contention rules apply,and binary exponential backoffmay beneeded if a collision occurs.The shortest interval isSIFS(Short InterFrameSpacing). Itis used to allowthe parties in a single dialog the chance to go first.'),\n",

Theshort interval, AIFS1,issmaller than DIFS butlonger than SIFS.It can be used by the AP to move voice or other high-prioritytraffictothe head of the line. The AP will wait for a shorter interval before it sendsthe voice traffic, and thus send it before regular traffic. The long interval, AIFS4,islarger than DIFS. It is used for background trafficthat can be deferred until afterregular traffic. TheAP will wait for a longer interval before it sends this traffic,giving regular trafficthe opportunity to transmit first. Thecomplete quality of ser-vice mechanism defines four different priority levels that have different backoffpa-rameters as well as different idle parameters.The last time interval,EIFS(Extended InterFrame Spacing), is used only byastation that has just receivedabad or unknown frame, to report the problem.Theidea is that since the receivermay have noidea of what is going on, it should waitawhile to avoid interfering with an ongoing dialog between twostations.Afurther part of the quality of service extensions is the notion of aTXOPortransmission opportunity.The original CSMA/CA mechanism let stations sendone frame at a time.This design was fine until the range of rates increased.With802.11a/g, one station might be sending at 6 Mbps and another station be sendingat 54 Mbps. Theyeach get to send one frame, but the 6-Mbps station takes ninetimes as long (ignoring fixed overheads) as the 54-Mbps station to send its frame.This disparity has the unfortunate side effect of slowing down a fast sender who iscompeting with a slowsender to roughly the rate of the slowsender.For example,again ignoring fixed overheads, when sending alone the 6-Mbps and 54-Mbpssenders will get their own rates, but when sending together theywill both get 5.4Mbps on average. Itis a stiffpenalty for the fast sender.This issue is known as therate anomaly(Heusse et al., 2003).'),\n",

Stations that send at a higher rate for their airtimewill get higher throughput. In our example, when sending together the 6-Mbps and54-Mbps senders will nowget 3 Mbps and 27 Mbps, respectively.4.4.4 The802.11 Frame StructureThe 802.11 standard defines three different classes of frames in the air: data,control, and management.Each of these has a header with a variety of fields usedwithin the MACsublayer.Inaddition, there are some headers used by the physicallayer,but these mostly deal with the modulation techniques used, so we will notdiscuss them here.We will look at the format of the data frame as an example. Itis shown inFig. 4-29.First comes theFrame controlfield, which is made up of 11 subfields.The first of these is theProtocol version,set to 00. It is there to allowfuture ver-sions of 802.11 to operate at the same time in the same cell.Then come theType(data, control, or management) andSubtypefields (e.g.,RTS,orCTS). For a regu-lar data frame (without quality of service), theyare set to 10 and 0000 in binary.TheTo DSandFr omDSbits are set to indicate whether the frame is going to orcoming from the network connected to the APs, which is called the distributionsystem. TheMorefragmentsbit means that more fragments will follow. TheRetrybit marks a retransmission of a frame sent earlier.ThePower managementbit indicates that the sender is going into power-save mode. TheMoredatabit in-dicates that the sender has additional frames for the receiver. TheProtected Framebit indicates that the frame body has been encrypted for security.Wewill discusssecurity briefly in the next section.Finally,theOrderbit tells the receiverthat thehigher layer expects the sequence of frames to arrive strictly in order.Bytes22 2 0–2312SequenceAddress 1(recipient)Duration DataFramecontrol Checksequence46 6 6Address 2(transmitter)Address 3\\n22 1 1Subtype= 0000Type= 10Version= 00 41ToDSFromDSMorefrag.RetryPwr.mgt.MoredataProtectedOrder1 11 1 1BitsFigure4-29.Format of the 802.11 data frame.The second field of the data frame, theDurationfield, tells howlong the frameand its acknowledgement will occupythe channel, measured in microseconds.It ispresent in all types of frames, including control frames, and is what stations use tomanage theNAVmechanism.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 345}, page_content='322 THE MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL SUBLAYER CHAP.4Next come addresses. Data frames sent to or from an AP have three addresses,all in standard IEEE 802 format.The first address is the receiver, and the secondaddress is the transmitter.Theyare obviously needed, but what is the third addressfor? Rememberthat the AP is simply a relay point for frames as theytravelbe-tween a client and another point on the network, perhaps a distant client or a portalto the Internet. The third address givesthis distant endpoint.TheSequencefield numbers frames so that duplicates can be detected.Of the16 bits available, 4 identify the fragment and 12 carry a number that is advancedwith each newtransmission. TheDatafield contains the payload, up to 2312bytes. Thefirst bytes of this payload are in a format known asLLC(Logical LinkControl). Thislayer is the glue that identifies the higher-layer protocol (e.g., IP)to which the payloads should be passed.Last comes theFrame checksequence,which is the same 32-bit CRC we sawinSec. 3.2.2 and elsewhere.Management frames have the same format as data frames, plus a format for thedata portion that varies with the subtype (e.g., parameters in beacon frames).Con-trol frames are short. Likeall frames, theyhavetheFrame control,Duration,andFrame checksequencefields. However, theymay have only one address and nodata portion.Most of the key information is conveyed with theSubtypefield (e.g.,ACK,RTS,andCTS).4.4.5 ServicesThe 802.11 standard defines the services that the clients, the access points, andthe network connecting them must be a conformant wireless LAN. The 802.11standard offers various services.Association and Data DeliveryTheassociationservice is used by mobile stations to connect themselves toAPs. Typically,itisused just after a station moveswithin radio range of the AP.Upon arrival, the station learns the identity and capabilities of the AP,either frombeacon frames or by directly asking the AP.The capabilities include the data ratessupported, security arrangements, power-saving capabilities, quality of service sup-port, and more.The AP’sbeacon message also includes aSSID(Service SetIDentifier), which most people often think of as the network name.The stationsends a request to associate with the AP; the AP may accept or reject the request.While beacons are always broadcast, the SSID may or may not be broadcast. If theSSID is not broadcast, the station must somehowknow(or discover) the name toassociate to that AP.Reassociationlets a station change its preferred AP.This is useful for mobilestations moving from one AP to another AP in the same extended 802.11 LAN,likeahandoverinthe cellular network. Ifused correctly,nodata will be lost as aconsequence of the handover. (But 802.11, likeEthernet, is a best-effort service.)'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 346}, page_content='SEC. 4.4 WIRELESS LANS 323No delivery guarantees are given. Eitherthe station or the AP may alsodisassoci-ate,ending the relationship.Astation should use this service before shutting downor leaving the network. TheAP may use it before going down for maintenance.The 802.11w standard added authentication to disassociation frames.Once frames reach the AP,thedistribution servicedetermines howtoroutethem. Ifthe destination is local to the AP,the frames can be sent out directly overthe air.Otherwise, theywill have tobeforwarded overthe wired network. Theintegration servicehandles anytranslation that is needed for a frame to be sentoutside the 802.11 LAN, or to arrive from outside the 802.11 LAN. The commoncase here is connecting the wireless LAN to the Internet.Data transmission is what it is all about, so 802.11 naturally provides adatadelivery service.This service lets stations transmit and receive data using the pro-tocols we described earlier in this chapter.Since 802.11 is modeled on Ethernetand transmission overEthernet is not guaranteed to be 100% reliable, transmissionover802.11 is not guaranteed to be reliable either.Higher layers must deal withdetecting and correcting errors.Security and PrivacyStations must alsoauthenticatebefore theycan send frames via the AP,butauthentication is handled in different ways depending on the choice of securityscheme. Ifthe 802.11 network is ‘‘open,’’ anyone is allowed to use it.Otherwise,credentials are needed to authenticate.Acommon authentication approach,WPA2(WiFi Protected Access 2), im-plements security as defined in the 802.11i standard.(WPAisaninterim schemethat implements a subset of 802.11i.We will skip it and go straight to the com-plete scheme.)With WPA2, the AP can talk to an authentication server that has ausername and password database to determine if the station is allowed to access thenetwork. Alternatively,apre-shared key,which is a fancyname for a networkpassword, may be configured. Several frames are exchanged between the stationand the AP with a challenge and response that lets the station prove ithas the rightcredentials. Thisexchange happens after association.Another authentication approach that is commonly used in enterprise networksis802.1X,which implements an approach calledport-based authentication.802.1X relies on centralized authentication (e.g., authentication of devices to acentralized server), which creates the possibilities for more fine-grained accesscontrol, accounting, billing, and attribution. Thestation that is authenticating issometimes called a supplicant; this device authenticates to the network through anauthenticator,which talks to the authentication server.802.1X relies on anauthentication framework calledEAP(Enhanced Authentication Protocol). TheEAP framework defines more than 50 different methods to perform authentication,butcommon methods includeEAP-TLS,which performs authentication based oncertificates;EAP-TTLSandPEAP,which allowthe client to associate using a'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 347}, page_content='324 THE MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL SUBLAYER CHAP.4variety of methods, including password-based authentication; andEAP-SIM,whereby a mobile phone can authenticate using a SIM.802.1X has manyadvan-tages oversimple WPA, such as the ability to perform fine-grained access controlbased on user,but it requires a certificate infrastructure to administer.The predecessor to WPAwas calledWEP(WiredEquivalent Privacy). Forthis scheme, authentication with a preshared key happens before association.WEPis nowwidely known to be insecure and is effectively no longer used.The firstpractical demonstration that WEP was broken came when Adam Stubblefield wasasummer intern at AT&T (Stubblefield et al., 2002).He was able to code up andtest an attack in one week, much of which was spent getting permission from man-agement to buy the WiFi cards needed for experiments. Software to crack WEPpasswords is nowfreely available.With WEP broken and WPAdeprecated, the next try was WPA2. Ituses a pri-vacy service that manages the details of encryption and decryption.The en-cryption algorithm for WPA2 is based onAES(Advanced Encryption Stan-dard), a U.S. government standard approvedin2002. Thekeys that are used forencryption are determined during the authentication procedure.Unfortunately,WPA2 was broken in 2017 (Vanhoef and Piessens, 2017).Good security is veryhard, evenwith unbreakable crypto, because key management is the weakest link.Prioritization and Power ControlTo handle trafficwith different priorities, there is aQoS traffic schedulingservice. It uses the protocols we described to give voice and video trafficpreferen-tial treatment compared to best-effort and background traffic. A companion servicealso provides higher-layer timer synchronization. This lets stations coordinate theiractions, which may be useful for media processing.Finally,there are twoservices that help stations manage their use of the spec-trum. Thetransmit power controlservice givesstations the information theyneedto meet regulatory limits on transmit power that vary from region to region. Thedynamic frequency selectionservice give stations the information theyneed toavoid transmitting on frequencies in the 5-GHz band that are being used for radarin the proximity.With these services, 802.11 provides a rich set of functionality for connectingnearby mobile clients to the Internet.It has been a huge success, and the standardhas repeatedly been amended to add more functionality.For a perspective onwhere the standard has been and where it is heading, see Hiertz et al.

All manner of consumer electronic devices nowuse Bluetooth, frommobile phones and laptops to headsets, printers, keyboards, mice, game consoles,watches, music players, navigation units, and more.The Bluetooth protocols letthese devices find and connect to each other,anact calledpairing,and securelytransfer data.The protocols have evolved overthe past decade, too. After the initial proto-cols stabilized, higher data rates were added to Bluetooth 2.0 in 2004.

That will be handy for people who do not want to change thebatteries regularly in all of those devices around the house.We will coverthe main aspects of Bluetooth 4.0 belowasitisstill the mostlywidely used version. Afterwards, we will discuss Bluetooth 5 and howitdiffersfrom Bluetooth 4.0 (mostly in minor ways).4.5.1 BluetoothArchitectureLet us start our study of the Bluetooth system with a quick overviewofwhat itcontains and what it is intended to do.The basic unit of a Bluetooth system is apiconet,which consists of a controller node and up to sevenactive worker nodeswithin a distance of 10 meters.Multiple piconets can exist in the same (large)room and can evenbeconnected via a bridge node that takes part in multiplepiconets, as in Fig.4-30. Aninterconnected collection of piconets is called ascat-ternet.In addition to the sevenactive worker nodes in a piconet, there can be up to255 parked nodes in the net.These are devices that the controller has switched to alow-power state to reduce the drain on their batteries.In parked state, a devicecannot do anything except respond to an activation or beacon signal from the con-troller.Two minor intermediate power states, hold and sniff, also existThe reason for the controller/worker design is that the designers intended tofacilitate the implementation of complete Bluetooth chips for under $5.Theconsequence of this decision is that the workers are fairly dumb, basically justdoing whateverthe controller tells them to do.At its heart, a piconet is a cent-ralized TDM system, with the controller controlling the clock and determiningwhich device gets to communicate in which time slot.All communication is be-tween the controller and a worker; direct worker-worker communication is not pos-sible.'),\n",

Theheadsetand hands-free profiles both provide voice communication between a headset andits base station, as might be used for hands-free telephonywhile driving a car.Other profiles are for streaming stereo-quality audio and video, say,from a porta-ble music player to headphones, or from a digital camera to a TV.The human interface device profile is for connecting keyboards and mice tocomputers. Otherprofiles let a mobile phone or other computer receive imagesfrom a camera or send images to a printer.Perhaps of more interest is a profile touse a mobile phone as a remote control for a (Bluetooth-enabled) TV.Still other profiles enable networking. Thepersonal area network profile letsBluetooth devices form an ad hoc network or remotely access another network,such as an 802.11 LAN, via an access point.The dial-up networking profile wasactually the original motivation for the whole project.It allows a (laptop) com-puter to connect to a mobile phone containing a built-in modem without using anycables, just radio signals.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 350}, page_content='SEC. 4.5 BLUETOOTH 327Profiles for higher-layer information exchange have also been defined. Thesynchronization profile is intended for loading data into a mobile phone when itleaveshome and collecting data from it when it returns.We will skip the rest of the profiles, except to mention that some profiles serveas building blocks on which the above profiles are built. Thegeneric access pro-file, on which all of the other profiles are built, provides a way to establish andmaintain secure links (channels) between the controller and the workers. Theothergeneric profiles define the basics of object exchange and audio and video transport.Utility profiles are used widely for functions such as emulating a serial line, whichis especially useful for manylegacy applications.Wasitreally necessary to spell out all these applications in detail and providedifferent protocol stacks for each one?Probably not, but there were a number ofdifferent working groups that devised different parts of the standard, and each onejust focused on its specific problem and generated its own profile. Thinkof this asConway’sLaw inaction. (Inthe April 1968 issue ofDatamationmagazine,Melvin Conway observed that if you assignnpeople to write a compiler,you willget ann-pass compiler,ormore generally,the software structure mirrors the struc-ture of the group that produced it.)It would probably have been possible to getawaywith twoprotocol stacks instead of 25, one for file transfer and one forstreaming real-time communication.4.5.3 TheBluetooth Protocol StackThe Bluetooth standard has manyprotocols grouped loosely into the layersshown in Fig.4-31.

Manyofthe concerns here have todowith the goal of making thesystem inexpensive sothat it can become a mass-market item.The link control (or baseband) layer is somewhat analogous to the MACsub-layer but also includes elements of the physical layer.Itdeals with howthe con-troller controls time slots and howthese slots are grouped into frames.Next come twoprotocols that use the link control protocol.The link managerhandles the establishment of logical channels between devices, including powermanagement, pairing and encryption, and quality of service.It lies belowthe hostcontroller interface line. This interface is a convenience for implementation: typi-cally,the protocols belowthe line will be implemented on a Bluetooth chip, andthe protocols above the line will be implemented on the Bluetooth device that hoststhe chip.The link protocol above the line isL2CAP(Logical Link Control Adapta-tion Protocol). Itframes variable-length messages and provides reliability if need-ed. Manyprotocols use L2CAP,such as the twoutility protocols that are shown.The service discovery protocol is used to locate services within the network. TheRFcomm (Radio Frequencycommunication) protocol emulates the standard serialport found on PCs for connecting the keyboard, mouse, and modem, among otherdevices.The top layer is where the applications are located.The profiles are repres-ented by vertical boxes because theyeach define a slice of the protocol stack for aparticular purpose.Specific profiles, such as the headset profile, usually containonly those protocols needed by that application and no others.Forexample, pro-files may include L2CAP if theyhavepackets to send but skip L2CAP if theyhaveonly a steady flowofaudio samples.In the following sections, we will examine the Bluetooth radio layer and vari-ous link protocols, since these roughly correspond to the physical and MACsublayers in the other protocol stacks we have studied.4.5.4 TheBluetooth Radio LayerThe radio layer movesthe bits from controller to worker,orvice versa. Itis alow-power system with a range of 10 meters operating in the same 2.4-GHz ISMband as 802.11.The band is divided into 79 channels of 1 MHz each.To coexistwith other networks using the ISM band, frequencyhopping spread spectrum isused. Therecan be up to 1600 hops/sec overslots with a dwell time of 625-µsec.All the nodes in a piconet hop frequencies simultaneously,following the slot tim-ing and pseudorandom hop sequence dictated by the controller.Unfortunately,itturned out that early versions of Bluetooth and 802.11 inter-fered enough to ruin each other’stransmissions. Somecompanies responded bybanning Bluetooth altogether,but eventually a technical solution was devised. The'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 352}, page_content='SEC. 4.5 BLUETOOTH 329solution is for Bluetooth to adapt its hop sequence to exclude channels on whichthere are other RF signals.This process reduces the harmful interference.It iscalledadaptive frequency hopping.Three forms of modulation are used to send bits on a channel.The basicscheme is to use frequencyshift keying to send a 1-bit symbol every microsecond,giving a gross data rate of 1 Mbps. Enhanced rates were introduced with the 2.0version of Bluetooth. These rates use phase shift keying to send either 2 or 3 bitsper symbol, for gross data rates of 2 or 3 Mbps. The enhanced rates are only usedin the data portion of frames.4.5.5 TheBluetooth Link LayersThe link control (or baseband) layer is the closest thing Bluetooth has to aMACsublayer.Itturns the rawbit stream into frames and defines some key for-mats. Inthe simplest form, the controller in each piconet defines a series of625-µsec time slots, with the controller’stransmissions starting in the evenslotsand the workers’ transmissions starting in the odd ones.This scheme is traditionaltime division multiplexing, with the controller getting half the slots and the work-ers sharing the other half.Frames can be 1, 3, or 5 slots long.Each frame has anoverhead of 126 bits for an access code and header,plus a settling time of 250–260µsec per hop to allowthe inexpensive radio circuits to become stable.The payloadof the frame can be encrypted for confidentiality with a key that is chosen when thecontroller and worker connect.Hops only happen between frames, not during aframe. Theresult is that a 5-slot frame is much more efficient than a 1-slot framebecause the overhead is constant but more data is sent.The link manager protocol sets up logical channels, calledlinks,tocarryframes between the controller and a worker device that have discovered each other.Apairing procedure is followed to makesure that the twodevices are allowed tocommunicate before the link is used.The old pairing method is that both devicesmust be configured with the same four-digit PIN (Personal Identification Number).The matching PIN is howeach device would knowthat it was connecting to theright remote device. However, unimaginative users and devices default to PINssuch as ‘‘0000’’and ‘‘1234’’meant that this method provided very little security inpractice.The newsecuresimple pairingmethod enables users to confirm that both de-vices are displaying the same passkey,ortoobservethe passkey onone device andenter it into the second device. Thismethod is more secure because users do nothave tochoose or set a PIN. Theymerely confirm a longer,device-generatedpasskey.Ofcourse, it cannot be used on some devices with limited input/output,such as a hands-free headset.Once pairing is complete, the link manager protocol sets up the links. Twomain kinds of links exist to carry the payload (user data).The first is theSCO(Synchronous Connection Oriented)link. Itis used for real-time data, such as'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 353}, page_content='330 THE MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL SUBLAYER CHAP.4telephone connections.This type of link is allocated a fixed slot in each direction.Aworker may have uptothree SCO links with its controller.Each SCO link cantransmit one 64,000-bps PCM audio channel.Due to the time-critical nature ofSCO links, frames sent overthem are neverretransmitted. Instead,forward errorcorrection can be used to increase reliability.The other kind is theACL(Asynchronous ConnectionLess)link. Thistypeof link is used for packet-switched data that is available irregularly.ACL trafficisdelivered on a best-effort basis without guarantees.Frames can be lost and mayhave toberetransmitted. Aworker may have only one ACL link to its controller.The data sent overACL links come from the L2CAP layer.This layer has fourmajor functions.First, it accepts packets of up to 64 KB from the upper layers andbreaks them into frames for transmission.At the far end, the frames are reassem-bled into packets. Second,it handles the multiplexing and demultiplexing of mul-tiple packet sources.When a packet has been reassembled, the L2CAP layer deter-mines which upper-layer protocol to hand it to, for example, RFcomm or servicediscovery.Third, L2CAP handles error control and retransmission.It detects er-rors and resends packets that were not acknowledged. Finally,L2CAP enforcesquality of service requirements between multiple links.4.5.6 TheBluetooth Frame StructureBluetooth defines several frame formats, the most important of which is shownin twoforms in Fig.4-32. Itbegins with an access code that usually identifies thecontroller so that workers within radio range of twocontrollers can tell which traf-ficisfor them.Next comes a 54-bit header containing typical MACsublayerfields. Ifthe frame is sent at the basic rate, the data field comes next. Ithas up to2744 bits for a five-slot transmission.Forasingle time slot, the format is the sameexcept that the data field is 240 bits.If the frame is sent at the enhanced rate, the data portion may have uptotwo orthree times as manybits because each symbol carries 2 or 3 bits instead of 1 bit.These data are preceded by a guard field and a synchronization pattern that is usedto switch to the faster data rate. That is, the access code and header are carried atthe basic rate and only the data portion is carried at the faster rate.Enhanced-rateframes end with a short trailer.Let us takeaquick look at the common header.TheAddressfield identifieswhich of the eight active devices the frame is intended for.TheTypefield identi-fies the frame type (ACL, SCO, poll, or null), the type of error correction used inthe data field, and howmanyslots long the frame is.TheFlowbit is asserted by aworker when its buffer is full and cannot receive any more data.This bit enables aprimitive form of flowcontrol. TheAcknowledgementbit is used to piggyback anACKonto a frame.TheSequencebit is used to number the frames to detect re-transmissions. Theprotocol is stop-and-wait, so 1 bit is enough.Then comes the8-bit headerChecksum.The entire 18-bit header is repeated three times to form'),\n",

Onthe receiving side, a simple circuit exam-ines all three copies of each bit.If all three are the same, the bit is accepted.Ifnot, the majority opinion wins.Thus, 54 bits of transmission capacity are used tosend 10 bits of header.The reason is that to reliably send data in a noisy environ-ment using cheap, low-powered (2.5 mW) devices with little computing capacity,agreat deal of redundancyisneeded.Various formats are used for the data field for ACL and SCO frames.Thebasic-rate SCO frames are a simple example to study: the data field is always 240bits. Threevariants are defined, permitting 80, 160, or 240 bits of actual payload,with the rest being used for error correction.In the most reliable version (80-bitpayload), the contents are just repeated three times, the same as the header.We can work out the capacity with this frame as follows. Sincethe workermay use only the odd slots, it gets 800 slots/sec, just as the controller does.Withan 80-bit payload, the channel capacity from the worker is 64,000 bps as is thechannel capacity from the controller.This capacity is exactly enough for a singlefull-duplexPCM voice channel (which is whyahop rate of 1600 hops/sec waschosen). Thatis, despite a rawbandwidth of 1 Mbps, a single full-duplexuncom-pressed voice channel can completely saturate the piconet.The efficiencyof13%is the result of spending 41% of the capacity on settling time, 20% on headers, and26% on repetition coding.This shortcoming highlights the value of the enhancedrates and frames of more than a single slot.4.5.7 Bluetooth5In June 2016, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group introduced Bluetooth 5.InJanuary 2019, it came out with Bluetooth 5.1.These were relatively minorupgrades to the Bluetooth 4 standard.Nevertheless, there are some differences'),\n",

Nonetheless, the protocol has various aspectsthat fit into the standard goals of the MACsublayer,including channel allocation(which occurs through a request-grant process), configuration of quality of service,and a unique forwarding model.This section addresses all three of these issues.More recently,full-duplexDOCSIS 3.1 (nowcalled DOCSIS 4.0) has introducednewtechnologies for scheduling and interference cancellation.DOCSIS has a standard MACframe format, which includes a set of fields, in-cluding the length of the MACframe, a checksum, and an extended header field,which supports a variety of functions, including link-layer security.Some headerssupport specific functions, including downstream timing, upstream power adjust-ment, bandwidth requests, and concatenation of frames.One specific type offrame is called a request frame, which is howthe cable modem requests band-width, as described later in this section.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 356}, page_content='SEC. 4.6 DOCSIS 3334.6.2 RangingAcable modem transmits what is called arangingrequest, which allows theCMTS (headend) to determine the network delay to the cable modem, as well as toperform and necessary power adjustments. Ranging is effectively the periodic tun-ing of the various transmission parameters, specifically timing, frequency, andpower.The CMTS polls the cable modem, which triggers the modem to submit aranging request. Based on this message, the CMTS provides the modem a responseto help the cable modem adjust signal transmission timing and power.Bydefault,ranging occurs about once every 30 seconds, but it can be configured to occurmore frequently; typical ranging intervals can be about 10 to 20 seconds.4.6.3 ChannelBandwidth AllocationADOCSIS CMTS allocates bandwidth to each cable modem through a re-quest-grant process. Each upstream or downstream trafficflowistypically assign-ed a service flow, and each service flowisallocated bandwidth by the CMTS.Service FlowsChannel allocation in DOCSIS typically involves allocation of channels be-tween oneCMTSand one or more cable modems, which are located in the sub-scribers’ homes.The CMTS must serveall of the upstream and downstream chan-nels, and it discards anyframe with a source MACaddress that is not one of the as-signed cable modems in the group.Central to the DOCSIS MAClayer is thenotion of aservice flow,which provides a way to manage both upstream anddownstream quality of service management.Each cable modem has an associatedservice flowID, which is negotiated during the registration of the cable modem;each cable modem can have multiple associated service flows. Different serviceflows can have different limitations that are associated with different types of traf-fic. For example, each service flowmight have a maximum packet size; or,aser-vice flowcould be dedicated to a certain type of application, such as a constant bitrate application. All cable modems must support at least one upstream and onedownstream service flow, called the primary service flow.The Request-Grant Process and Low-Latency DOCSISWhen a cable modem has data to send, it sends a short request that tells theCMTS howmuch data it has to send and waits for a subsequent bandwidth alloca-tion message, which describes the upstream transmission opportunities that a send-er may have totransmit data.Upstream transmission is divided into discrete intervals by an upstream band-width allocation mechanism called aminislot.Aminislot is simply a time unit of'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 357}, page_content='334 THE MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL SUBLAYER CHAP.4granularity for upstream transmission, typically in 6.25µsec increments. Depend-ing on the version of DOCSIS, a minislot may need to be a power-of-twomultipleof this increment; in more modern versions of DOCSIS, this restriction does notapply.Byadjusting the minislots that are granted to a particular service flow, theCMTS can effectively implement quality of service and prioritization for differenttrafficflows.Generally speaking, quality of service has allowed the CMTS to allocate morebandwidth to different cable modems (thus allowing a subscriber who is provi-sioned for a higher tier of service to achieve a higher service level). Morerecently,however, revisions to DOCSIS have also allowed differentiated service for latency-sensitive applications. Specifically,anew revision to the DOCSIS protocol allowsfor lowlatency, through a newspecification calledLLD(Low-Latency DOCSIS)LLD recognizes that for manyinteractive applications, such as gaming and videoconferencing, lowlatencyisasimportant as high throughput.In some cases, inexisting DOCSIS networks, the latencyfor some flows can be quite high, due toboth the time to acquire the shared media and the time for queueing.LLD addresses these issues by shortening the round-trip delay associated withthe request-grant process, and by using twoqueues—one queue for latency-sensi-tive application trafficand a second queue for trafficthat is not latency-sensitive.The shorter request-grant delay reduces the amount of time that the CMTS uses toperform scheduling calculations, to 1 millisecond from a previous time interval of2–4 milliseconds. LLD also uses mechanisms to proactively schedule grants to aservice flowtoeliminate delay associated with the request-grant process entirely.LLD allows applications to determine whether theyhavepackets that cannot bequeued, through the marking of a differentiated service field in the DOCSIS frame.Formore information on LLD, see White (2019).4.7 DAT ALINK LAYER SWITCHINGManyorganizations have multiple LANs and wish to connect them.Would itnot be convenient if we could just join the LANs together to makealarger LAN?In fact, we can do this when the connections are made with devices calledbridges.The Ethernet switches we described in Sec. 4.3.4 are a modern name for bridges;theyprovide functionality that goes beyond classic Ethernet and Ethernet hubs tomakeiteasy to join multiple LANs into a larger and faster network. Weshall usethe terms ‘‘bridge’’and ‘‘switch’’interchangeably.Bridges operate in the data link layer,sotheyexamine the data link layer ad-dresses to forward frames.Since theyare not supposed to examine the payloadfield of the frames theyforward, theycan handle IP packets as well as other kindsof packets, such as AppleTalk packets. Incontrast,routersexamine the addressesin packets and route based on them, so theyonly work with the protocols that theywere designed to handle.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 358}, page_content='SEC. 4.7 DATA LINK LAYER SWITCHING 335In this section, we will look at howbridges work and are used to join multiplephysical LANs into a single logical LAN.We will also look at howtodothe re-verse and treat one physical LAN as multiple logical LANs, called virtual LANs.Both technologies provide useful flexibility for managing networks. For a compre-hensive treatment of bridges, switches, and several related topics, see Perlman(2000) and Yu(2011).4.7.1 Usesof BridgesBefore getting into the technology of bridges, let us takealook at some com-mon situations in which bridges are used.We will mention three reasons whyasingle organization may end up with multiple LANs.First, manyuniversity and corporate departments have their own LANs to con-nect their own personal computers, servers, and devices such as printers.Since thegoals of the various departments differ,different departments may set up differentLANs, without regard to what other departments are doing.Sooner or later,though, there is a need for interaction, so bridges are needed.In this example,multiple LANs come into existence due to the autonomy of their owners.Second, the organization may be geographically spread overseveral buildingsseparated by considerable distances.It may be cheaper to have separate LANs ineach building and connect them with bridges and a fewlong-distance fiber opticlinks than to run all the cables to a single central switch.Even if laying the cablesis easy to do, there are limits on their lengths (e.g., 200 m for twisted-pair gigabitEthernet). Thenetwork would not work for longer cables due to the excessive sig-nal attenuation or round-trip delay.The only solution is to partition the LAN andinstall bridges to join the pieces to increase the total physical distance that can becovered.Third, it may be necessary to split what is logically a single LAN into separateLANs (connected by bridges) to accommodate the load.At manylarge universi-ties, for example, thousands of workstations are available for student and facultycomputing. Companiesmay also have thousands of employees. Thescale of thissystem precludes putting all the workstations on a single LAN—there are morecomputers than ports on anyEthernet hub and more stations than allowed on a sin-gle classic Ethernet.Even if it were possible to wire all the workstations together,putting more sta-tions on an Ethernet hub or classic Ethernet would not add capacity.All of the sta-tions share the same, fixed amount of bandwidth. The more stations there are, theless average bandwidth per station.However, two separate LANs have twice the capacity of a single LAN. Bridgeslet the LANs be joined together while keeping this capacity.The key isnot to sendtrafficonto ports where it is not needed, so that each LAN can run at full speed.This behavior also increases reliability,since on a single LAN a defective node thatkeeps outputting a continuous stream of garbage can clog up the entire LAN.By'),\n",

Itshould be possible to go out and buy bridges, plug the LAN cablesinto the bridges, and have everything work perfectly,instantly.There should be nohardware changes required, no software changes required, no setting of addressswitches, no downloading of routing tables or parameters, nothing at all.Just plugin the cables and walk away. Furthermore, the operation of the existing LANsshould not be affected by the bridges at all.As far as the stations are concerned,there should be no observable difference whether or not theyare part of a bridgedLAN. Itshould be as easy to move stations around the bridged LAN as it is tomove them around a single LAN.Surprisingly enough, it is actually possible to create bridges that are transpar-ent. Two algorithms are used: a backward learning algorithm to stop trafficbeingsent where it is not needed; and a spanning tree algorithm to break loops that maybe formed when switches are cabled together willy-nilly.Let us nowtakealook atthese algorithms in turn to learn howthis magic is accomplished.4.7.2 Learning BridgesThe topology of twoLANs bridged together is shown in Fig.4-33 for twocases. Onthe left-hand side, twomultidrop LANs, such as classic Ethernets, arejoined by a special station—the bridge—that sits on both LANs. On the right-handside, LANs with point-to-point cables, including one hub, are joined together.Thebridges are the devices to which the stations and hub are attached.If the LANtechnology is Ethernet, the bridges are better known as Ethernet switches.\\n(a) (b)\\nA D\\nBridgeB112PortB\\nC\\nE\\nGFCBridgeB1B2AB G\\nDH1Port12 134 234 FEHub\\nFigure4-33.(a) Bridge connecting twomultidrop LANs.(b) Bridges (and ahub) connecting sevenpoint-to-point stations.Bridges were developed when classic Ethernets were in use, so theyare oftenshown in topologies with multidrop cables, as in Fig.4-33(a). However, all the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 360}, page_content='SEC. 4.7 DATA LINK LAYER SWITCHING 337topologies that are encountered today are comprised of point-to-point cables andswitches. Thebridges work the same way in both settings.All of the stations at-tached to the same port on a bridge belong to the same collision domain, and this isdifferent than the collision domain for other ports.If there is more than one sta-tion, as in a classic Ethernet, a hub, or a half-duplexlink, the CSMA/CD protocolis used to send frames.There is a difference, however, inhow the bridged LANs are built. Tobridgemultidrop LANs, a bridge is added as a newstation on each of the multidropLANs, as in Fig.4-33(a). Tobridge point-to-point LANs, the hubs are either con-nected to a bridge or,preferably,replaced with a bridge to increase performance. InFig. 4-33(b), bridges have replaced all but one hub.Different kinds of cables can also be attached to one bridge. For example, thecable connecting bridgeB1to bridgeB2in Fig.4-33(b) might be a long-distancefiber optic link, while the cable connecting the bridges to stations might be a short-haul twisted-pair line. This arrangement is useful for bridging LANs in differentbuildings.Nowlet us consider what happens inside the bridges.Each bridge operates inpromiscuous mode, that is, it accepts every frame transmitted by the stations at-tached to each of its ports.The bridge must decide whether to forward or discardeach frame, and, if the former,onwhich port to output the frame.This decision ismade by using the destination address.As an example, consider the topology ofFig. 4-33(a).If stationAsends a frame to stationB,bridgeB1will receive theframe on port 1. This frame can be immediately discarded without further ado be-cause it is already on the correct port.However, inthe topology of Fig.4-33(b)suppose thatAsends a frame toD.BridgeB1will receive the frame on port 1 andoutput it on port 4.BridgeB2will then receive the frame on its port 4 and output iton its port 1.Asimple way to implement this scheme is to have a big (hash) table inside thebridge. Thetable can list each possible destination and which output port it be-longs on.Forexample, in Fig.4-33(b), the table atB1would listDas belonging toport 4, since allB1has to knowiswhich port to put frames on to reachD.That, infact, more forwarding will happen later when the frame hitsB2is not of interest toB1.When the bridges are first plugged in, all the hash tables are empty.None ofthe bridges knowwhere anyofthe destinations are, so theyuse a flooding algo-rithm: every incoming frame for an unknown destination is output on all the portsto which the bridge is connected except the one it arrivedon. Astime goes on, thebridges learn where destinations are.Once a destination is known, frames destinedfor it are put only on the proper port; theyare not flooded.The algorithm used by the bridges isbackward learning.Asmentionedabove,the bridges operate in promiscuous mode, so theysee every frame sent onanyoftheir ports.By looking at the source addresses, theycan tell which ma-chines are accessible on which ports.Forexample, if bridgeB1in Fig.4-33(b)'),\n",

Anysubsequent frame addressed toCcoming in toB1on anyother port will be forwarded to port 3.The topology can change as machines and bridges are powered up and downand movedaround. Tohandle dynamic topologies, wheneverahash table entry ismade, the arrivaltime of the frame is noted in the entry.Wheneveraframe whosesource is already in the table arrives, its entry is updated with the current time.Thus, the time associated with every entry tells the last time a frame from that ma-chine was seen.Periodically,aprocess in the bridge scans the hash table and purges all entriesmore than a fewminutes old.In this way,ifacomputer is unplugged from itsLAN, movedaround the building, and plugged in again somewhere else, within afewminutes it will be back in normal operation, without anymanual intervention.This algorithm also means that if a machine is quiet for a fewminutes, anytrafficsent to it will have tobeflooded until it next sends a frame itself.The routing procedure for an incoming frame depends on the port it arriveson(the source port) and the address to which it is destined (the destination address).The procedure is as follows.1. Ifthe port for the destination address is the same as the source port,discard the frame.2. Ifthe port for the destination address and the source port are different,forward the frame on to the destination port.3. Ifthe destination port is unknown, use flooding and send the frame onall ports except the source port.Youmight wonder whether the first case can occur with point-to-point links. Theanswer is that it can occur if hubs are used to connect a group of computers to abridge. An example is shown in Fig.4-33(b) where stationsEandFare connectedto hubH1, which is in turn connected to bridgeB2.IfEsends a frame toF,thehub will relay it toB2as well as toF.That is what hubs do—theywire all portstogether so that a frame input on one port is simply output on all other ports.Theframe will arrive atB2on port 2, which is already the right output port to reach thedestination. BridgeB2need only discard the frame.As each frame arrives, this algorithm must be applied, so it is usually imple-mented with special-purpose VLSI chips.The chips do the lookup and update thetable entry,all in a fewmicroseconds. Becausebridges only look at the MACad-dresses to decide howtoforward frames, it is possible to start forwarding as soonas the destination header field has come in, before the rest of the frame has arrived(provided the output line is available, of course).This design reduces the latencyof passing through the bridge, as well as the number of frames that the bridge mustbe able to buffer.Itisreferred to ascut-through switchingorwormhole routingand is usually handled in hardware.'),\n",

Thiscycle goes on forever.The solution to this difficulty is for the bridges to communicate with eachother and overlay the actual topology with a spanning tree that reaches everybridge. Ineffect, some potential connections between bridges are ignored in theinterest of constructing a fictitious loop-free topology that is a subset of the actualtopology.Forexample, in Fig.4-36 we see fivebridges that are interconnected and alsohave stations connected to them.Each station connects to only one bridge.Thereare some redundant connections between the bridges so that frames will be for-warded in loops if all of the links are used. This topology can be thought of as agraph in which the bridges are the nodes and the point-to-point links are the edges.The graph can be reduced to a spanning tree, which has no cycles by definition, bydropping the links shown as dashed lines in Fig.4-36. Usingthis spanning tree,there is exactly one path from every station to every other station.Once thebridges have agreed on the spanning tree, all forwarding between stations follows'),\n",

The dashed lines are linksthat are not part of the spanning tree.To build the spanning tree, the bridges run a distributed algorithm.Eachbridge periodically broadcasts a configuration message out all of its ports to itsneighbors and processes the messages it receivesfrom other bridges, as describednext. Thesemessages are not forwarded, since their purpose is to build the tree,which can then be used for forwarding.The bridges must first choose one bridge to be the root of the spanning tree.To makethis choice, theyeach include an identifier based on their MACaddress inthe configuration message, as well as the identifier of the bridge theybelieve tobethe root.MACaddresses are installed by the manufacturer and guaranteed to beunique worldwide, which makes these identifiers convenient and unique.Thebridges choose the bridge with the lowest identifier to be the root.After enoughmessages have been exchanged to spread the news, all bridges will agree on whichbridge is the root.In Fig.4-36, bridgeB1has the lowest identifier and becomesthe root.Next, a tree of shortest paths from the root to every bridge is constructed. InFig. 4-36,bridgesB2andB3can each be reached from bridgeB1directly,inonehop that is a shortest path.BridgeB4can be reached in twohops, via eitherB2orB3.Tobreak this tie, the path via the bridge with the lowest identifier is chosen, soB4is reached viaB2.BridgeB5can be reached in twohops viaB3.To find these shortest paths, bridges include the distance from the root in theirconfiguration messages. Each bridge remembers the shortest path it finds to theroot. Thebridges then turn offports that are not part of the shortest path.Although the tree spans all the bridges, not all the links (or evenbridges) arenecessarily present in the tree.This happens because turning offthe ports prunessome links from the network to prevent loops.Even after the spanning tree hasbeen established, the algorithm continues to run during normal operation to auto-matically detect topology changes and update the tree.'),\n",

In 2001, it was revised to more rapidly find a newspanning tree after atopology change.Foradetailed treatment of bridges, see Perlman (2000).4.7.4 Repeaters,Hubs, Bridges, Switches, Routers, and GatewaysSo far in this book, we have looked at a variety of ways to get frames andpackets from one computer to another.Wehavementioned repeaters, hubs,bridges, switches, routers, and gateways. Allof these devices are in common use,buttheyall differ in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Sincethere are so manyofthem, it is probably worth taking a look at them together to see what the simi-larities and differences are.The key tounderstanding these devices is to realize that theyoperate in dif-ferent layers, as illustrated in Fig.4-37(a). Thelayer matters because different de-vices use different pieces of information to decide howtoswitch. Inatypicalscenario, the user generates some data to be sent to a remote machine.Those dataare passed to the transport layer,which then adds a header (for example, a TCPheader) and passes the resulting unit down to the network layer.The network layeradds its own header to form a network layer packet (e.g., an IP packet). InFig. 4-37(b), we see the IP packet shaded in gray.Then, the packet goes to the datalink layer,which adds its own header and checksum (CRC) and givesthe resultingframe to the physical layer for transmission, for example, overaLAN.Nowlet us look at the switching devices and see howtheyrelate to the packetsand frames.At the bottom, in the physical layer,wefind the repeaters.These areanalog devices that work with signals on the cables to which theyare connected.'),\n",

Repeatersdo not understand frames, packets, or headers.Theyunderstandthe symbols that encode bits as volts. ClassicEthernet, for example, was designedto allowfour repeaters that would boost the signal to extend the maximum cablelength from 500 meters to 2500 meters.Next we come to the hubs.Ahub has a number of input lines that it joins elec-trically.Frames arriving on anyofthe lines are sent out on all the others.If twoframes arrive atthe same time, theywill collide, just as on a coaxial cable.All thelines coming into a hub must operate at the same speed.Hubs differ from re-peaters in that theydonot (usually) amplify the incoming signals and are designedfor multiple input lines, but the differences are slight.Likerepeaters, hubs arephysical layer devices that do not examine the link layer addresses or use them inanyway.Nowlet us move uptothe data link layer,where we find bridges and switches.We just studied bridges at some length.Abridge connects twoormore LANs.Likeahub, a modern bridge has multiple ports, usually enough for 4 to 48 inputlines of a certain type.Unlikeinahub, each port is isolated to be its own collisiondomain; if the port has a full-duplexpoint-to-point line, the CSMA/CD algorithmis not needed.When a frame arrives, the bridge extracts the destination addressfrom the frame header and looks it up in a table to see where to send the frame.ForEthernet, this address is the 48-bit destination address shown in Fig.4-14. Thebridge only outputs the frame on the port where it is needed and can forward multi-ple frames at the same time.Bridges offer much better performance than hubs, and the isolation betweenbridge ports also means that the input lines may run at different speeds, possiblyevenwith different network types.Acommon example is a bridge with ports thatconnect to 10-, 100-, and 1000-Mbps Ethernet.Buffering within the bridge isneeded to accept a frame on one port and transmit the frame out on a different port.If frames come in faster than theycan be retransmitted, the bridge may run out of'),\n",

Different frame formats require copyingand reformatting, which takes CPU time, requires a newchecksum calculation, andintroduces the possibility of undetected errors due to bad bits in the bridge’smem-ory.Different maximum frame lengths are also a serious problem with no goodsolution. Basically,frames that are too large to be forwarded must be discarded. Somuch for transparency.Twoother areas where LANs can differ are security and quality of service.Some LANs have link-layer encryption, for example 802.11, and some do not, forexample Ethernet. Some LANs have quality of service features such as priorities,for example 802.11, and some do not, for example Ethernet. Consequently,when aframe must travelbetween these LANs, the security or quality of service expectedby the sender may not be able to be provided. For all of these reasons, modernbridges usually work for one network type, and routers, which we will come tosoon, are used instead to join networks of different types.Switches are modern bridges by another name.The differences are more to dowith marketing than technical issues, but there are a fewpoints worth knowing.Bridges were developed when classic Ethernet was in use, so theytend to join rel-atively fewLANs and thus have relatively fewports. The term ‘‘switch’’ismorepopular nowadays. Also,modern installations all use point-to-point links, such astwisted-pair cables, so individual computers plug directly into a switch and thusthe switch will tend to have manyports. Finally,‘‘switch’’isalso used as a generalterm. With a bridge, the functionality is clear.Onthe other hand, a switch mayrefer to an Ethernet switch or a completely different kind of device that makes for-warding decisions, such as a telephone switch.So far,wehaveseen repeaters and hubs, which are actually quite similar,aswell as bridges and switches, which are evenmore similar to each other.Now wemove uptorouters, which are different from all of the above.When a packetcomes into a router,the frame header and trailer are stripped offand the packet lo-cated in the frame’spayload field (shaded in Fig.4-37) is passed to the routingsoftware. Thissoftware uses the packet header to choose an output line.ForanIPpacket, the packet header will contain a 32-bit (IPv4) or 128-bit (IPv6) address, butnot a 48-bit IEEE 802 address.The routing software does not see the frame ad-dresses and does not evenknowwhether the packet came in on a LAN or a point-to-point line.We will study routers and routing in Chap. 5.Up another layer,wefind transport gateways.

It refers to a forwardingprocess that runs at a high layer.4.7.5 Virtual LANsIn the early days of local area networking, thick yellowcables snaked throughthe cable ducts of manyoffice buildings. Every computer theypassed was pluggedin. Nothought was giventowhich computer belonged on which LAN.All thepeople in adjacent offices were put on the same LAN, whether theybelonged to-gether or not.Geographytrumped corporate organization charts.With the advent of twisted pair and hubs in the 1990s, all that changed.Build-ings were rewired (at considerable expense) to rip out all the yellowgarden hosesand install twisted pairs from every office to central wiring closets at the end ofeach corridor or in a central machine room, as illustrated in Fig.4-38. Ifthe VicePresident in Charge of Wiring was a visionary,Category 5 twisted pairs were in-stalled; if he was a bean counter,the existing (Category 3) telephone wiring wasused (only to be replaced a fewyears later,when fast Ethernet emerged).Today,the cables have changed and hubs have become switches, but the wiringpattern is still the same.This pattern makes it possible to configure LANs logi-cally rather than physically.For example, if a companywantskLANs, it couldbuykswitches. Bycarefully choosing which connectors to plug into whichswitches, the occupants of a LAN can be chosen in a way that makes organiza-tional sense, without too much regard to geography.Does it matter who is on which LAN?After all, in nearly all organizations, allthe LANs are interconnected.In short, yes, it often matters.Network administra-tors liketogroup users on LANs to reflect the organizational structure rather thanthe physical layout of the building, for a variety of reasons.One issue is security.One LAN might host Web servers and other computers intended for public use.Another LAN might host computers containing the records of the Human Re-sources department that are not to be passed outside of the department.In such asituation, putting all the computers on a single LAN and not letting anyofthe ser-vers be accessed from offthe LAN makes sense.Management tends to frownwhen hearing that such an arrangement is impossible.Asecond issue is load.Some LANs are more heavily used than others and itmay be desirable to separate them.Forexample, if the folks in research are run-ning all kinds of nifty experiments that sometimes get out of hand and completely'),\n",

Thenagain, this might impress on management the need to install a faster net-work.Athird issue is broadcast traffic. Bridgesbroadcast trafficwhen the locationof the destination is unknown, and upper-layer protocols use broadcasting as well.Forexample, when a user wants to send a packet to an IP addressx,how does itknowwhich MACaddress to put in the frame?We will study this question inChap. 5, but briefly summarized, the answer is that it broadcasts a frame con-taining the question ‘‘who owns IP addressx?’’Then it waits for an answer.Asthenumber of computers in a LAN grows, so does the number of broadcasts. Eachbroadcast consumes more of the LAN capacity than a regular frame because it isdelivered to every computer on the LAN. By keeping LANs no larger than theyneed to be, the impact of broadcast trafficisreduced.Related to broadcasts is the problem that once in a while a network interfacewill break down or be misconfigured and begin generating an endless stream ofbroadcast frames. If the network is really unlucky, some of these frames will elicitresponses that lead to evermore traffic. The result of thisbroadcast stormis that(1) the entire LAN capacity is occupied by these frames, and (2) all the machineson all the interconnected LANs are crippled just processing and discarding all theframes being broadcast.At first it might appear that broadcast storms could be limited in scope andreach by separating the LANs with bridges or switches, but if the goal is to achieve'),\n",

This results in wasted switchports that are not used.In manycompanies, organizational changes occur all the time, meaning thatsystem administrators spend a lot of time pulling out plugs and pushing them backin somewhere else.Also, in some cases, the change cannot be made at all becausethe twisted pair from the user’smachine is too far from the correct switch (e.g., inthe wrong building), or the available switch ports are on the wrong LAN.In response to customer requests for more flexibility,network vendors beganworking on a way to rewire buildings entirely in software. Theresulting concept iscalled aVLAN(Virtual LAN). Ithas been standardized by the IEEE 802 com-mittee and is nowwidely deployed in manyorganizations. Letus nowtakealookat it.VLANs are based on VLAN-aware switches.To set up a VLAN-based net-work, the network administrator decides howmanyVLANs there will be, whichcomputers will be on which VLAN, and what the VLANs will be called.Often theVLANs are (informally) named by colors, since it is then possible to print colordiagrams showing the physical layout of the machines, with the members of thered LAN in red, members of the green LAN in green, and so on.In this way,boththe physical and logical layouts are visible in a single view.As an example, consider the bridged LAN of Fig.4-39, in which nine of themachines belong to the G (gray) VLAN and fivebelong to the W (white) VLAN.Machines from the gray VLAN are spread across twoswitches, including twoma-chines that connect to a switch via a hub.To makethe VLANs function correctly,configuration tables have tobeset upin the bridges.These tables tell which VLANs are accessible via which ports.When a frame comes in from, say,the gray VLAN, it must be forwarded on all theports marked with a G.This holds for ordinary (i.e., unicast) trafficfor which thebridges have not learned the location of the destination, as well as for multicast andbroadcast traffic. Notethat a port may be labeled with multiple VLAN colors.'),\n",

This sends the frame to one further station and the hub (whichwill transmit the frame to all of its stations).The hub has both labels because itconnects to machines from both VLANs.The frame is not sent on other portswithout G in the label because the bridge knows that there are no machines on thegray VLAN that can be reached via these ports.In our example, the frame is only sent from bridgeB1to bridgeB2becausethere are machines on the gray VLAN that are connected toB2.Looking at thewhite VLAN, we can see that the bridgeB2port that connects to bridgeB1isnotlabeled W.This means that a frame on the white VLAN will not be forwardedfrom bridgeB2to bridgeB1.This behavior is correct because no stations on thewhite VLAN are connected toB1.The IEEE 802.1Q StandardTo implement this scheme, bridges need to knowtowhich VLAN an incomingframe belongs. Without this information, for example, when bridgeB2gets a framefrom bridgeB1in Fig.4-39, it cannot knowwhether to forward the frame on thegray or white VLAN.If we were designing a newtype of LAN, it would be easyenough to just add a VLAN field in the header.But what to do about Ethernet,which is the dominant LAN, and did not have any spare fields lying around for theVLAN identifier?The IEEE 802 committee had this problem thrown into its lap in 1995.Aftermuch discussion, it did the unthinkable and changed the Ethernet header.The newformat was published in IEEE standard802.1Q,issued in 1998.The newformat'),\n",

Afewquestions that come to mind are:1. Needwe throwout several hundred million existing Ethernet cards?2. Ifnot, who generates the newfields?3. Whathappens to frames that are already the maximum size?Of course, the 802 committee was (only too painfully) aware of these problemsand had to come up with solutions, which it did.The key tothe solution is to realize that the VLAN fields are only actuallyused by the bridges and switches andnotby the user machines.Thus, in Fig.4-39,it is not really essential that theyare present on the lines going out to the end sta-tions as long as theyare on the line between the bridges.Also, to use VLANs, thebridges have tobeVLAN aware. Thisfact makes the design feasible.As to throwing out all existing Ethernet cards, the answer is no.Rememberthat the 802.3 committee could not evenget people to change theTypefield into aLengthfield. You can imagine the reaction to an announcement that all existingEthernet cards had to be thrown out.However, new Ethernet cards are 802.1Qcompliant and can correctly fill in the VLAN fields.Because there can be computers (and switches) that are not VLAN aware, thefirst VLAN-aware bridge to touch a frame adds VLAN fields and the last onedown the road removesthem. Anexample of a mixed topology is shown inFig. 4-40.In this figure, VLAN-aware computers generate tagged (i.e., 802.1Q)frames directly,and further switching uses these tags.The shaded symbols areVLAN-aware and the empty ones are not.\\nLegacybridgeand host\\nB1 B2 B5Taggedframe B4\\nB3\\nB6VLAN-awarehost and bridge\\nLegacyframe\\nFigure4-40.Bridged LAN that is only partly VLAN aware.

Thefirst one is theVLAN protocol ID.Italways has the value 0x8100.Since this number is greaterthan 1500, all Ethernet cards interpret it as a type rather than a length.What alegacy card does with such a frame is moot since such frames are not supposed tobe sent to legacy cards.802.3LengthDataPadCheck-sumDestinationaddressSourceaddress802.1QLengthDataPadTag\\nVLAN IdentifierVLAN protocolID (0x8100)PriCFI\\nCheck-sumDestinationaddressSourceaddress\\nFigure4-41.The 802.3 (legacy)and 802.1Q Ethernet frame formats.The second 2-byte field contains three subfields.

Itwould be a terrible shame to lose that property.Fortu-nately,VLAN-aware bridges can also autoconfigure themselves based on observ-ing the tags that come by.Ifaframe tagged as VLAN 4 comes in on port 3, appar-ently some machine on port 3 is on VLAN 4.The 802.1Q standard explains howto build the tables dynamically,mostly by referencing appropriate portions of the802.1D standard.Before leaving the subject of VLAN routing, it is worth making one last obser-vation. Manypeople in the Internet and Ethernet worlds are fanatically in favorofconnectionless networking and violently opposed to anything smacking of con-nections in the data link or network layers.YetVLANs introduce something thatis surprisingly similar to a connection.To use VLANs properly,each frame carriesanew special identifier that is used as an indexinto a table inside the switch tolook up where the frame is supposed to be sent.That is precisely what happens inconnection-oriented networks. Inconnectionless networks, it is the destination ad-dress that is used for routing, not some kind of connection identifier.Wewill seemore of this creeping connectionism in Chap. 5.4.8 SUMMARYSome networks have a single channel that is used for all communication.Inthese networks, the key design issue is the allocation of this channel among thecompeting stations wishing to use it.FDM and TDM are simple, efficient alloca-tion schemes when the number of stations is small and fixed and the trafficiscon-tinuous. Bothare widely used under these circumstances, for example, for divid-ing up the bandwidth on telephone trunks.However, when the number of stationsis large and variable or the trafficisfairly bursty—the common case in computernetworks—FDM and TDM are poor choices.Numerous dynamic channel allocation algorithms have been devised.

Asan improvement when the state ofthe channel can be sensed, stations can avoid starting a transmission while anotherstation is transmitting. This technique, carrier sensing, has led to a variety ofCSMA protocols for LANs and MANs.It is the basis for classic Ethernet and802.11 networks.Aclass of protocols that eliminates contention altogether,oratleast reduces itconsiderably,has been well known for years.The bitmap protocol, topologies suchas rings, and the binary countdown protocol completely eliminate contention.Thetree-walk protocol reduces it by dynamically dividing the stations into twodisjointgroups of different sizes and allowing contention only within one group; ideallythat group is chosen so that only one station is ready to send when it is permitted todo so. Modern versions of MACprotocols, including DOCSIS and Bluetooth, ex-plicitly takesteps to avoid contention by assigning transmission intervals to send-ers.Wireless LANs have the added problems that it is difficult to sense collidingtransmissions, and that the coverage regions of stations may differ.Inthe domi-nant wireless LAN, IEEE 802.11, stations use CSMA/CA to mitigate the firstproblem by leaving small gaps to avoid collisions.The stations can also use theRTS/CTS protocol to combat hidden terminals that arise because of the secondproblem, although the overhead of RTS/CTS is so high in practice due to theexposed terminal problem that it is often not used, especially in dense environ-ments.In contrast, manyclients nowuse mechanisms to perform channel selection toavoid contention.IEEE 802.11 is commonly used to connect laptops and other de-vices to wireless access points, but it can also be used between devices. Anyofseveral physical layers can be used, including multichannel FDM with and withoutmultiple antennas, and spread spectrum. Modern versions of 802.11 include securi-ty features at the link layer,including support for authentication, as well as ad-vanced encoding to support MIMO transmission.Ethernet is the dominant form of wired LAN.Classic Ethernet usedCSMA/CD for channel allocation on a yellowcable the size of a garden hose thatsnaked from machine to machine.The architecture has changed as speeds haverisen from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps and continue to climb.Now point-to-point linkssuch as twisted pair are attached to hubs and switches. With modern switches andfull-duplexlinks, there is no contention on the links and the switch can forwardframes between different ports in parallel.With buildings full of LANs, a way is needed to interconnect them all.Plug-and-play bridges are used for this purpose.The bridges are built with a backwardlearning algorithm and a spanning tree algorithm.Since this functionality is builtinto modern switches, the terms ‘‘bridge’’and ‘‘switch’’are used interchangeably.To help with the management of bridged LANs, VLANs let the physical topologybe divided into different logical topologies.The VLAN standard, IEEE 802.1Q,introduces a newformat for Ethernet frames.'),\n",

Itmust also takecare when choosing routes toavoid overloading some of the communication lines and routers while leaving oth-ers idle.Finally,when the source and destination are in different independentlyoperated networks, sometimes called autonomous systems, newchallenges arise,such as coordinating trafficflows across multiple networks and managing networkutilization. Theseproblems are typically handled at the network layer; networkoperators are often tasked with dealing with these challenges manually.Conven-tionally,network operators had to reconfigure the network layer manually,throughlow-levelconfiguration.

Animportant question is precisely what kind of ser-vices the network layer provides to the transport layer.The services need to becarefully designed with the following goals in mind:1. Theservices should be independent of the router technology.2. Thetransport layer should be shielded from the number,type, andtopology of the routers present.3. Thenetwork addresses made available to the transport layer shoulduse a uniform numbering plan, evenacross LANs and WANs.Giventhese goals, the designers of the network layer have a lot of freedom inwriting detailed specifications of the services to be offered to the transport layer.This freedom often degenerates into a raging battle between twowarring factions.The discussion centers on whether the network layer should provide connec-tion-oriented service or connectionless service.One camp (represented by the Internet community) argues that the routers’ jobis moving packets around and nothing else.In this view(based on 40 years ofexperience with a real computer network), the network is inherently unreliable, nomatter howitisdesigned. Therefore,the hosts should accept this fact and do errorcontrol (i.e., error detection and correction) and flowcontrol themselves.This viewpoint leads to the conclusion that the network service should be con-nectionless, with primitivesSEND PACKETandRECEIVE PACKETand little else.In particular,nopacket ordering and flowcontrol should be done, because thehosts are going to do that anyway and there is usually little to be gained by doing ittwice. Thisreasoning is an example of theend-to-end argument,adesign prin-ciple that has been very influential in shaping the Internet (Saltzer et al., 1984).Furthermore, each packet must carry the full destination address, because eachpacket sent is carried independently of its predecessors, if any.The other camp (represented by the telephone companies) argues that the net-work should provide a reliable, connection-oriented service.Theyclaim that100 yearsof successful experience with the worldwide telephone system is anexcellent guide.In this view, quality of service is the dominant factor,and withoutconnections in the network, quality of service is very difficult to achieve,especial-ly for real-time trafficsuch as voice and video.Even after several decades, this controversy is still very much alive.Early,widely used data networks, such as X.25 in the 1970s and its successor FrameRelay in the 1980s, were connection-oriented. However, since the days of theARPANET and the early Internet, connectionless network layers have growntremendously in popularity.The IP protocol is nowanever-present symbol of suc-cess. It was undeterred by a connection-oriented technology called ATM that was'),\n",

Underthe covers, how-ever, the Internet is evolving connection-oriented features as quality of service be-comes more important.Twoexamples of connection-oriented technologies aremultiprotocol label switching, which we will describe in this chapter,and VLANs,which we sawinChap. 4.Both technologies are widely used.5.1.3 Implementationof Connectionless ServiceHaving looked at the twoclasses of service the network layer can provide to itsusers, it is time to see howthis layer works inside.Twodifferent organizations arepossible, depending on the type of service offered. Ifconnectionless service is of-fered, packets are injected into the network individually and routed independentlyof each other.Noadvance setup is needed.In this context, the packets are fre-quently calleddatagrams(in analogy with telegrams) and the network is called adatagram network.Ifconnection-oriented service is used, a path from the sourcerouter all the way to the destination router must be established before anydatapackets can be sent.This connection is called aVC(Virtual Circuit), in analogywith the physical circuits set up by the (old) telephone system, and the network iscalled avirtual-circuit network.Inthis section, we will examine datagram net-works; in the next one, we will examine virtual-circuit networks.Let us nowsee howadatagram network works. Supposethat the processP1in Fig.5-2 has a long message forP2.Ithands the message to the transport layer,with instructions to deliverittoprocessP2on hostH2.The transport layer coderuns onH1,typically within the operating system.It prepends a transport headerto the front of the message and hands the result to the network layer,probably justanother procedure within the operating system.Let us assume for this example that the message is four times longer than themaximum packet size, so the network layer has to break it into four packets, 1, 2,3, and 4, and send each of them in turn to routerAusing some point-to-point proto-col, for example, PPP.Atthis point the ISP takes over. Every router has an inter-nal table telling it where to send packets for each of the possible destinations.Each table entry is a pair consisting of a destination and the outgoing line to usefor that destination.Only directly connected lines can be used.Forexample, inFig. 5-2,Ahas only twooutgoing lines—toBand toC—so every incoming packetmust be sent to one of these routers, evenifthe ultimate destination is to someother router.A’s initial routing table is shown in the figure under the label ‘‘ini-tially.’’AtA,packets 1, 2, and 3 are stored briefly,having arrivedonthe incoming linkand had their checksums verified.

Perhapsithas learned of a trafficjam somewhere along theACEpath and updated its routingtable, as shown under the label ‘‘later.’’The algorithm that manages the tables andmakes the routing decisions is called therouting algorithm.Routing algorithmsare one of the main topics we will study in this chapter.There are several differentkinds of them, as we will see.IP,which is the basis for the entire Internet, is the dominant example of a con-nectionless network service.Each packet carries a destination IP address that rout-ers use to individually forward each packet. The addresses are 32 bits in IPv4 pack-ets and 128 bits in IPv6 packets. Wewill describe IP and these twoversions inmuch detail later in this chapter.5.1.4 Implementationof Connection-Oriented ServiceForconnection-oriented service, we need to have a virtual-circuit network. Letus see howthat works. Theidea behind virtual circuits is to avoid having tochoose a newroute for every packet sent, as in Fig.5-2. Instead,when a con-nection is established, a route from the source machine to the destination machineis chosen as part of the connection setup and stored in tables inside the routers.That route is used for all trafficflowing overthe connection, exactly the same way'),\n",

Whenthe connection is released, the virtual cir-cuit is also terminated.With connection-oriented service, each packet carries anidentifier telling which virtual circuit it belongs to.As an example, consider the situation illustrated in Fig.5-3.

Onetrade-offissetup time versus address parsing time.Using virtual cir-cuits requires a setup phase, which takes time and consumes resources.However,once this price is paid, figuring out what to do with a data packet in a virtual-cir-cuit network is easy: the router just uses the circuit number to indexinto a table tofind out where the packet goes.In a datagram network, no setup is needed but amore complicated lookup procedure is required to locate the entry for the destina-tion.Arelated issue is that the destination addresses used in datagram networks arelonger than circuit numbers used in virtual-circuit networks because theyhaveaglobal meaning.If the packets tend to be fairly short, including a full destination'),\n",

Oncethe packets start arriving, the necessary bandwidth and router capaci-ty will be there.With a datagram network, congestion avoidance is more difficult.Fortransaction processing systems (e.g., stores calling up to verify credit cardpurchases), the overhead required to set up and clear a virtual circuit may easilydwarf the use of the circuit.If the majority of the trafficisexpected to be of thiskind, the use of virtual circuits inside the network makes little sense.On the otherhand, for long-running uses such as VPN trafficbetween twocorporate offices,permanent virtual circuits (that are set up manually and last for months or years)may be useful.Virtual circuits also have a vulnerability problem.If a router crashes and losesits memory,evenifitcomes back up a second later,all the virtual circuits passingthrough it will have tobeaborted. Incontrast, if a datagram router goes down,only those users whose packets were queued in the router at the time need suffer(and probably not eventhen since the sender is likely to retransmit them shortly).The loss of a communication line is fatal to virtual circuits using it, but can easilybe compensated for if datagrams are used.Datagrams also allowthe routers to bal-ance the trafficthroughout the network, since routes can be changed partwaythrough a long sequence of packet transmissions.5.2 ROUTING ALGORITHMS IN A SINGLE NETWORKThe main function of the network layer is routing packets from the source ma-chine to the destination machine. In this section, we discuss howthe network layerachievesthis function within a single administrative domain or autonomous sys-tem. Inmost networks, packets will require multiple hops to makethe journey.The only notable exception is for broadcast networks, but evenhere routing is anissue if the source and destination are not on the same network segment. Thealgo-rithms that choose the routes and the data structures that theyuse are a major areaof network layer design.Therouting algorithmis that part of the network layer software responsiblefor deciding which output line an incoming packet should be transmitted on.If thenetwork uses datagrams internally,the routing decision must be made anewfor'),\n",

Onecan think of a router as having twoprocesses inside it.One ofthem handles each packet as it arrives, looking up the outgoing line to use for it inthe routing tables.This process isforwarding.The other process is responsiblefor filling in and updating the routing tables.That is where the routing algorithmcomes into play.Regardless of whether routes are chosen independently for each packet sent oronly when newconnections are established, certain properties are desirable in arouting algorithm: correctness, simplicity,robustness, stability,fairness, and ef-ficiency. Correctness and simplicity hardly require comment, but the need for ro-bustness may be less obvious at first. Onceamajor network comes on the air,itmay be expected to run continuously for years without system-wide failures. Dur-ing that period there will be hardware and software failures of all kinds.Hosts,routers, and lines will fail repeatedly,and the topology will change manytimes.The routing algorithm should be able to cope with changes in the topology andtrafficwithout requiring all jobs in all hosts to be aborted. Imagine the havocifthenetwork needed to be rebooted every time some router crashed.Stability is also an important goal for the routing algorithm.There exist rout-ing algorithms that neverconvergetoafixed set of paths, no matter howlong theyrun. Astable algorithm reaches equilibrium and stays there.It should convergequickly too, since communication may be disrupted until the routing algorithm hasreached equilibrium.Fairness and efficiencymay sound obvious—surely no reasonable personwould oppose them—but as it turns out, theyare often contradictory goals.As asimple example of this conflict, look at Fig.5-5. Supposethat there is enough traf-ficbetweenAandAv ,betweenBandBv ,and betweenCandCv to saturate the hori-zontal links.To maximize the total flow, theXtoXv trafficshould be shut offalto-gether.Unfortunately,XandXv may not see it that way.Evidently,some compro-mise between global efficiencyand fairness to individual connections is needed.Before we can evenattempt to find trade-offs between fairness and efficiency,we must decide what it is we seek to optimize.Minimizing the mean packet delayis an obvious candidate to send trafficthrough the network effectively,but so ismaximizing total network throughput.Furthermore, these twogoals are also inconflict, since operating anyqueueing system near capacity implies a long queue-ing delay.Asacompromise, manynetworks attempt to minimize the distance apacket must travel, or alternatively,simply reduce the number of hops a packetmust make. Either choice tends to improve the delay and also reduce the amount of'),\n",

Instead,the choiceof the route to use to get fromItoJ(for allIandJ)iscomputed in advance,offline, and downloaded to the routers when the network is booted.This procedureis sometimes calledstatic routing.Because it does not respond to failures, staticrouting is mostly useful for situations in which the routing choice is clear.For ex-ample, routerFin Fig.5-3 should send packets headed into the network to routerEregardless of the ultimate destination.Adaptive algorithms,incontrast, change their routing decisions to reflectchanges in the topology,and sometimes changes in the trafficaswell. Thesedynamic routingalgorithms differ in where theyget their information (e.g.,locally,from adjacent routers, or from all routers), when theychange the routes(e.g., when the topology changes, or every6 Tseconds as the load changes), andwhat metric is used for optimization (e.g., distance, number of hops, or estimatedtransit time).In the following sections, we will discuss a variety of routing algorithms. Thealgorithms coverdelivery models besides sending a packet from a source to a dest-ination. Sometimesthe goal is to send the packet to multiple, all, or one of a set ofdestinations. Allthe routing algorithms we describe here makedecisions based onthe topology; we defer the possibility of decisions based on the traffictoSec. 5.3.5.2.1 TheOptimality PrincipleBefore we get into specific algorithms, it may be helpful to note that one canmakeageneral statement about optimal routes without regard to network topologyor traffic. Thisstatement is known as theoptimality principle(Bellman, 1957).\"),\n",

Suchatree is called asink treeand is illustrated in Fig.5-6(b) for the net-work of Fig.5-6(a).

If we allowall of the possible paths to be chosen, the tree be-comes a more general structure called aDAG(Directed Acyclic Graph). DAGshave noloops. Wewill use sink trees as a convenient shorthand for both cases.Both cases also depend on the technical assumption that the paths do not interferewith each other so, for example, a trafficjam on one path will not cause anotherpath to divert.Since a sink tree is indeed a tree, it does not contain anyloops, so each packetwill be delivered within a finite and bounded number of hops.In practice, life isnot quite this easy.Links and routers can go down and come back up during oper-ation, so different routers may have different ideas about the current topology.Also, we have quietly finessed the issue of whether each router has to individuallyacquire the information on which to base its sink tree computation or whether thisinformation is collected by some other means.We will come back to these issuesshortly.Nevertheless, the optimality principle and the sink tree provide a bench-mark against which other routing algorithms can be measured.'),\n",

These paths are theones that we want a distributed routing algorithm to find, eventhough not all rout-ers may knowall of the details of the network.The idea is to build a graph of the network, with each node of the graph repres-enting a router and each edge of the graph representing a communication line, orlink. Tochoose a route between a givenpair of routers, the algorithm just finds theshortest path between them on the graph.The concept of ashortest pathdeserves some explanation. Onewayofmea-suring path length is the number of hops.Using this metric, the pathsABCandABEin Fig.5-7 are equally long.Another metric is the geographic distance inkilometers, in which caseABCis clearly much longer thanABE(assuming the fig-ure is drawn to scale).\\nA D126G4(a)\\nF (' , < ) D (' ,< )\\nAB7 C2H3322FE1226G4\\nA (c)AB (2, A) C (9, B)\\nH (' , < )E (4, B)G (6, A)\\nF (6, E) D (' ,< )A (e)AB (2, A) C (9, B)\\nH (9, G)E (4, B)G (5, E) F (6,E) D (' ,< )A (f)AB (2, A) C (9, B)\\nH (8, F)E (4, B)G (5, E)\\nF (6, E) D (' ,1)A (d)AB (2, A) C (9, B)\\nH (' , < )E (4, B)G (5, E)\\nF (' , < ) D (' , < )A HEG(b)\\nB (2, A) C (' , < )\\nH (' , < )E (' , < )G (6, A)\\nFigure5-7.The first six steps used in computing the shortest path fromAtoD.The arrows indicate the working node.However, manyother metrics besides hops and physical distance are also pos-sible.

Bychanging the weighting function, the algorithm would then com-pute the ‘‘shortest’’path measured according to anyone of a number of criteria orto a combination of criteria.Several algorithms for computing the shortest path between twonodes of agraph are known. Thisone is due to Dijkstra (1959) and finds the shortest pathsbetween a source and all destinations in the network. Eachnode is labeled (in par-entheses) with its distance from the source node along the best known path.Thedistances must be non-negative,astheywill be if theyare based on real quantitieslikebandwidth and delay.Initially,nopaths are known, so all nodes are labeledwith infinity.Asthe algorithm proceeds and paths are found, the labels maychange, reflecting better paths.Alabel may be either tentative orpermanent. Ini-tially,all labels are tentative.When it is discovered that a label represents theshortest possible path from the source to that node, it is made permanent and neverchanged thereafter.To illustrate howthe labeling algorithm works, look at the weighted, undi-rected graph of Fig.5-7(a), where the weights represent, for example, distance.We want to find the shortest path fromAtoD.Westart out by marking nodeAaspermanent, indicated by a filled-in circle.Then we examine, in turn, each of thenodes adjacent toA(the working node), relabeling each one with the distance toA.Wheneveranode is relabeled, we also label it with the node from which the probewasmade so that we can reconstruct the final path later.Ifthe network had morethan one shortest path fromAtoDand we wanted to find all of them, we wouldneed to remember all of the probe nodes that could reach a node with the same dis-tance.Having examined each of the nodes adjacent toA,weexamine all the tenta-tively labeled nodes in the whole graph and makethe one with the smallest labelpermanent, as shown in Fig. 5-7(b).This one becomes the newworking node.We now start atBand examine all nodes adjacent to it.If the sum of the labelonBand the distance fromBto the node being considered is less than the label onthat node, we have a shorter path, so the node is relabeled.After all the nodes adjacent to the working node have been inspected and thetentative labels changed if possible, the entire graph is searched for the tentativelylabeled node with the smallest value. Thisnode is made permanent and becomesthe working node for the next round.Figure 5-7 shows the first six steps of thealgorithm.To see whythe algorithm works, look at Fig.5-7(c). Atthis point we have justmadeEpermanent. Supposethat there were a shorter path thanABE,sayAXYZE(for someXandY). Thereare twopossibilities: either nodeZhas already beenmade permanent, or it has not been.If it has, thenEhas already been probed (on'),\n",

Thereason forsearching backward is that each node is labeled with its predecessor rather than itssuccessor.When the final path is copied into the output variable,path,the path isthus reversed. Thetworeversal effects cancel, and the answer is produced in thecorrect order.5.2.3 FloodingWhen a routing algorithm is implemented, each router must makedecisionsbased on local knowledge, not the complete picture of the network. Asimple localtechnique isflooding,inwhich every incoming packet is sent out on every out-going line except the one it arrivedon.Flooding obviously generates vast numbers of duplicate packets, in fact, aninfinite number unless some measures are taken to damp the process.One suchmeasure is to have a hop counter contained in the header of each packet that isdecremented at each hop, with the packet being discarded when the counterreaches zero.Ideally,the hop counter should be initialized to the length of the pathfrom source to destination.If the sender does not knowhow long the path is, it caninitialize the counter to the worst case, namely,the full diameter of the network.Flooding with a hop count can produce an exponential number of duplicatepackets as the hop count grows and routers duplicate packets theyhaveseen be-fore. Abetter technique for damming the flood is to have routers keep track ofwhich packets have been flooded, to avoid sending them out a second time.Onewaytoachieve this goal is to have the source router put a sequence number in eachpacket it receivesfrom its hosts.Each router then needs a list per source router tel-ling which sequence numbers originating at that source have already been seen.Ifan incoming packet is on the list, it is not flooded.To prevent the list from growing without bound, each list should be augmentedby a counter,k,meaning that all sequence numbers throughkhave been seen.When a packet comes in, it is easy to check if the packet has already been flooded(by comparing its sequence number tok); if so, it is discarded.Furthermore, the'),\n",

Even if large numbers of routers areblown to smithereens (e.g., in a military network located in a war zone), floodingwill find a path if one exists, to get a packet to its destination.Flooding also re-quires little in the way of setup. The routers only need to knowtheir neighbors.This means that flooding can be used as a building block for other routing algo-rithms that are more efficient but need more in the way of setup.Flooding can alsobe used as a metric against which other routing algorithms can be compared.Flooding always chooses the shortest path because it chooses every possible pathin parallel.Consequently,noother algorithm can produce a shorter delay (if weignore the overhead generated by the flooding process itself).5.2.4 DistanceVector RoutingComputer networks generally use dynamic routing algorithms that are morecomplexthan flooding, but more efficient because theyfind shortest paths for thecurrent topology.Two dynamic algorithms in particular,distance vector routingand link state routing, are the most popular.Inthis section, we will look at the for-mer algorithm.In the following section, we will study the latter algorithm.Adistance vector routingalgorithm operates by having each router maintainatable (i.e., a vector) giving the best known distance to each destination and whichlink to use to get there.These tables are updated by exchanging information withthe neighbors. Eventually,every router knows the best link to reach each destina-tion.The distance vector routing algorithm is sometimes called by other names,most commonly the distributedBellman-Fordrouting algorithm, after the re-searchers who developed it (Bellman, 1957; and Ford and Fulkerson, 1962).It wasthe original ARPANET routing algorithm and was also used in the Internet underthe name RIP.In distance vector routing, each router maintains a routing table indexedby,and containing one entry for,each router in the network. Thisentry has twoparts:the preferred outgoing line to use for that destination, and an estimate of the dis-tance to that destination.The distance might be measured as the number of hopsor using another metric, as we discussed for computing shortest paths.The router is assumed to knowthe ‘‘distance’’toeach of its neighbors.If themetric is hops, the distance is just one hop.If the metric is propagation delay,therouter can measure it directly with specialECHOpackets that the receiverjusttimestamps and sends back as fast as it can.As an example, assume that delay is used as a metric and that the router knowsthe delay to each of its neighbors.Once everyTmsec, each router sends to eachneighbor a list of its estimated delays to each destination.It also receivesasimilar'),\n",

Therehave been manyattempts to solveit, for example, preventing routersfrom advertising their best paths back to the neighbors from which theyheardthem. Splithorizon with poisoned reverse rule are discussed in RFC 1058.How-ever, none of these heuristics work well in practice despite the colorful names.Thecore of the problem is that whenXtellsYthat it has a path somewhere,Yhas nowayofknowing whether it itself is on the path.5.2.5 LinkState RoutingDistance vector routing was used in the ARPANET until 1979, when it was re-placed by link state routing.The primary problem that caused its demise was thatthe algorithm often took too long to convergeafter the network topology changed(due to the count-to-infinity problem).Consequently,itwas replaced by an en-tirely newalgorithm, nowcalledlink state routing.Variants of link state routingcalled IS-IS and OSPF are the routing algorithms that are most widely used insidelarge networks and the Internet today.The idea behind link state routing is fairly simple and can be stated as fiveparts. Eachrouter must do the following things to makeitwork:1. Discoverits neighbors and learn their network addresses.2. Setthe distance or cost metric to each of its neighbors.3. Constructapacket telling all it has just learned.4. Sendthis packet to and receive packets from all other routers.5. Computethe shortest path to every other router.'),\n",

Therouter on the other end is expected to send back a reply giving its name.These names must be globally unique because when a distant router later hears thatthree routers are all connected toF,itisessential that it can determine whether allthree mean the sameF.When twoormore routers are connected by a broadcast link (e.g., a switch,ring, or classic Ethernet), the situation is slightly more complicated.Figure5-11(a) illustrates a broadcast LAN to which three routers,A,C,andF,are directlyconnected.

For example, 1-GbpsEthernet may have a cost of 1 and 100-Mbps Ethernet may have a cost of 10.Thismakes higher-capacity paths better choices.If the network is geographically spread out, the delay of the links may be fac-tored into the cost so that paths overshorter links are better choices.The mostdirect way to determine this delay is to send overthe line a specialECHOpacketthat the other side is required to send back immediately.Bymeasuring the round-trip time and dividing it by two, the sending router can get an estimate of the delay.Building Link State PacketsOnce the information needed for the exchange has been collected, the next stepis for each router to build a packet containing all the data.The packet starts withthe identity of the sender,followed by a sequence number and age (to be describedlater) and a list of neighbors.The cost to each neighbor is also given.

An-other possibility is to build them when some specific event occurs, such as a line orneighbor going down or coming back up again or changing its properties.Distributing the Link State PacketsThe trickiest part of the algorithm is distributing the link state packets. Allofthe routers must get all of the link state packets quickly and reliably.Ifdifferentrouters are using different versions of the topology,the routes theycompute canhave inconsistencies, such as loops, unreachable machines, and other problems.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 403}, page_content='380 THE NETWORK LAYER CHAP.5First, we will describe the basic distribution algorithm.After that, we will givesome refinements. Thefundamental idea is to use flooding to distribute the linkstate packets to all routers.To keep the flood in check, each packet contains a se-quence number that is incremented for each newpacket sent.Routers keep trackof all the (source router,sequence) pairs theysee. Whenanew link state packetcomes in, it is checked against the list of packets already seen.If it is new, itisfor-warded on all lines except the one it arrivedon. Ifit is a duplicate, it is discarded.If a packet with a sequence number lower than the highest one seen so far everar-rives, it is rejected as being obsolete as the router has more recent data.This algorithm has a fewproblems, but theyare manageable.First, if the se-quence numbers wrap around, confusion will reign.The solution here is to use a32-bit sequence number.With one link state packet per second, it would take137years to wrap around, so this possibility can be ignored.Second, if a router evercrashes, it will lose track of its sequence number.Ifitstarts again at 0, the next packet it sends will be rejected as a duplicate.Third, if a sequence number is evercorrupted and 65,540 is receivedinstead of4(a1-bit error), packets 5 through 65,540 will be rejected as obsolete, since thecurrent sequence number will be thought to be 65,540.The solution to these problems is to include the age of each packet after the se-quence number and decrement it once a second.When the age hits zero, the infor-mation from that router is discarded.Normally,anew packet comes in, say,every10 sec, so router information only times out when a router is down (or six consecu-tive packets have been lost, an unlikely event). TheAgefield is also decrementedby each router during the initial flooding process, to makesure no packet can getlost and live for an indefinite period of time (a packet with age zero is discarded).Some refinements to this algorithm makeitmore robust. Whenalink statepacket comes in to a router for flooding, it is not queued for transmission im-mediately.Instead, it is put in a holding area to wait a short while in case morelinks are coming up or going down. Ifanother link state packet from the samesource comes in before the first packet is transmitted, their sequence numbers arecompared. Iftheyare equal, the duplicate is discarded.If theyare different, theolder one is thrown out.To guard against errors on the links, all link state packetsare acknowledged.The data structure used by routerBfor the network shown in Fig.5-12(a) isdepicted in Fig.5-13. Eachrowhere corresponds to a recently arrived, but as yetnot fully processed, link state packet. Thetable records where the packet origi-nated, its sequence number and age, and the data.In addition, there are send andacknowledgement flags for each ofB’s three links (toA,C,andF,respectively).The send flags mean that the packet must be sent on the indicated link.The ac-knowledgement flags mean that it must be acknowledged there.In Fig.5-13, the link state packet fromAarrivesdirectly,soitmust be sent toCandFand acknowledged toA,asindicated by the flag bits.Similarly,the packetfromFhas to be forwarded toAandCand acknowledged toF.'),\n",

For example, if a copyofC’s state arrivesfromFbefore the fourth entryin the table has been forwarded, the six bits will be changed to 100011 to indicatethat the packet must be acknowledged toFbutnot sent there.Computing the New RoutesOnce a router has accumulated a full set of link state packets, it can constructthe entire network graph because every link is represented.Every link is, in fact,represented twice, once for each direction.The different directions may evenhavedifferent costs.The shortest-path computations may then find different paths fromrouterAtoBthan from routerBtoA.NowDijkstra’salgorithm can be run locally to construct the shortest paths toall possible destinations.The results of this algorithm tell the router which link touse to reach each destination.This information is installed in the routing tables,and normal operation is resumed.Compared to distance vector routing, link state routing requires more memoryand computation.Foranetwork withnrouters, each of which haskneighbors, thememory required to store the input data is proportional tokn,which is at least aslarge as a routing table listing all the destinations.Also, the computation timegrows faster thankn,evenwith the most efficient data structures, an issue in largenetworks. Nevertheless, in manypractical situations, link state routing works wellbecause it does not suffer from slowconvergence problems.Link state routing is widely used in actual networks, so a fewwords aboutsome example protocols are in order.ManyISPs use theIS-IS(Intermediate Sys-tem-to-Intermediate System)link state protocol (Oran, 1990).It was designed'),\n",

OSPF(Open Shortest Path First), which will be discussed in Sec.5.7.6, is the other mainlink state protocol.It was designed by IETF several years after IS-IS and adoptedmanyofthe innovations designed for IS-IS.These innovations include a self-stabi-lizing method of flooding link state updates, the concept of a designated router onaLAN, and the method of computing and supporting path splitting and multiplemetrics. Asaconsequence, there is very little difference between IS-IS and OSPF.The most important difference is that IS-IS can carry information about multiplenetwork layer protocols at the same time (e.g., IP,IPX, and AppleTalk). OSPFdoes not have this feature, and it is an advantage in large multiprotocol environ-ments.Ageneral comment on routing algorithms is also in order.Link state, distancevector,and other algorithms rely on processing at all the routers to compute routes.Problems with the hardware or software at evenasmall number of routers canwreak havocacross the network. For example, if a router claims to have a link itdoes not have orforgets a link it does have,the network graph will be incorrect.Ifarouter fails to forward packets or corrupts them while forwarding them, the routewill not work as expected. Finally,ifitruns out of memory or does the routing cal-culation wrong, bad things will happen.As the network grows into the range oftens or hundreds of thousands of nodes, the probability of some router failing occa-sionally becomes nonnegligible. Thetrick is to try to arrange to limit the damagewhen the inevitable happens.Perlman (1988) discusses these problems and theirpossible solutions in detail.5.2.6 Hierarchical Routing within a NetworkAs networks growinsize, the router routing tables growproportionally.Notonly is router memory consumed by ever-increasing tables, but more CPU time isneeded to scan them and more bandwidth is needed to send status reports aboutthem. Additionally,evenifevery router could store the entire topology,recomput-ing shortest paths every time the network experienced changes in the topologywould be prohibitive;imagine, for example, if a very large network would need tocomputer shortest paths every time a link in the network failed or recovered. Atacertain point, the network may growtoasize where it is no longer feasible forevery router to have anentry for every other router,sothe routing will have tobedone hierarchically,through the use ofrouting areas.When hierarchical routing is used, the routers are divided into what we willcallregionsorareas.Each router knows all the details about howtoroute packetsto destinations within its own region but knows nothing about the internal structureof other regions. Whendifferent networks are interconnected, it is natural toregard each one as a separate region to free the routers in one network from havingto knowthe topological structure of the other ones.'),\n",

Asan ex-ample of a simple multilevelhierarchy, consider howapacket might be routedfrom Berkeley, California, to Malindi, Kenya. TheBerkeleyrouter would knowthe detailed topology within California but would send all out-of-state traffictotheLos Angeles router.The Los Angeles router would be able to route trafficdirectlyto other domestic routers but would send all foreign traffictoNew York. TheNewYork router would be programmed to direct all traffictothe router in the destina-tion country responsible for handling foreign traffic, say,inNairobi.

Afterasufficient number of hops, each packet will carry only one destina-tion likeanormal packet. Multidestinationrouting is likeusing separately ad-dressed packets, except that when several packets must followthe same route, oneof them pays full fare and the rest ride free.The network bandwidth is thereforeused more efficiently.However, this scheme still requires the source to knowallthe destinations, plus it is as much work for a router to determine where to sendone multidestination packet as it is for multiple distinct packets.We havealready seen a better broadcast routing technique: flooding.Whenimplemented with a sequence number per source, flooding uses links efficiently'),\n",

However, itturns out that we can do better still once the shortestpath routes for regular packets have been computed.The idea forreverse path forwardingis elegant and remarkably simple onceit has been pointed out (Dalal and Metcalfe, 1978).When a broadcast packet ar-rivesatarouter,the router checks to see if the packet arrivedonthe link that is nor-mally used for sending packetstowardthe source of the broadcast.If so, there isan excellent chance that the broadcast packet itself followed the best route from therouter and is therefore the first copytoarrive atthe router.This being the case, therouter forwards copies of it onto all links except the one it arrivedon. If,however,the broadcast packet arrivedonalink other than the preferred one for reaching thesource, the packet is discarded as a likely duplicate.

It makes explicit use of the sink tree—or anyother convenient spanningtree for that matter—for the router initiating the broadcast.Aspanning treeis asubset of the network that includes all the routers but contains no loops. Sink treesare spanning trees.If each router knows which of its lines belong to the spanningtree, it can copyanincoming broadcast packet onto all the spanning tree lines ex-cept the one it arrivedon. Thismethod makes excellent use of bandwidth, generat-ing the absolute minimum number of packets necessary to do the job.InFig. 5-15,for example, when the sink tree of part (b) is used as the spanning tree, the broad-cast packet is sent with the minimum 14 packets. Theonly problem is that eachrouter must have knowledge of some spanning tree for the method to be applicable.Sometimes this information is available (e.g., with link state routing, all routersknowthe complete topology,sotheycan compute a spanning tree) but sometimesit is not (e.g., with distance vector routing).5.2.8 MulticastRoutingSome applications, such as a multiplayer game or live video of a sports eventstreamed to manyviewing locations, send packets to multiple receivers. Unlessthegroup is very small, sending a distinct packet to each receiverisexpensive.Ontheother hand, broadcasting a packet is wasteful if the group consists of, say,1000machines on a million-node network, so that most receivers are not interested inthe message (or worse yet, theyare definitely interested but are not supposed to seeit, for example, because it is part of a pay-per-viewsports event). Thus,we need awaytosend messages to well-defined groups that are numerically large in size butsmall compared to the network as a whole.Sending a message to such a group is calledmulticasting,and the routing al-gorithm used is calledmulticast routing.All multicasting schemes require somewaytocreate and destroygroups and to identify which routers are members of agroup. Howthese tasks are accomplished is not of concern to the routing algo-rithm. For now, wewill assume that each group is identified by a multicast addressand that routers knowthe groups to which theybelong. Wewill revisit group mem-bership when we describe Internet multicasting in Sec. 5.7.8.Multicast routing schemes build on the broadcast routing schemes we have al-ready studied, sending packets along spanning trees to deliverthe packets to themembers of the group while making efficient use of bandwidth.However, the bestspanning tree to use depends on whether the group is dense, with receivers scat-tered overmost of the network, or sparse, with much of the network not belongingto the group.In this section we will consider both cases.If the group is dense, broadcast is a good start because it efficiently gets thepacket to all parts of the network.

The solution explored by Deeringand Cheriton (1990) is to prune the broadcast spanning tree by removing links thatdo not lead to members. The result is an efficient multicast spanning tree.As an example, consider the twogroups, 1 and 2, in the network shown inFig. 5-16(a).Some routers are attached to hosts that belong to none, one or both ofthese groups, as indicated in the figure.

Theresult is the multicast spanning tree for the leftmost router tosend to group 1.Packets are forwarded only along this spanning tree, which ismore efficient than the broadcast tree because there are 7 links instead of 10.Fig. 5-16(d)shows the multicast spanning tree after pruning for group 2.It is ef-ficient too, with only fivelinks this time.It also shows that different multicastgroups have different spanning trees.\\n1, 21\\n1, 22 1 12\\n2\\n12 1, 21, 22 21 1\\n11\\n1 1\\n1\\n2222 2\\n(a) (b)\\n(c) (d)Figure5-16.(a) A network.

However, wheneverarouter with nohosts interested in a particular group and no connections to other routers receivesamulticast message for that group, it responds with aPRUNEmessage, telling theneighbor that sent the message not to send it anymore multicasts from the senderfor that group.When a router with no group members among its own hosts has re-ceivedsuch messages on all the lines to which it sends the multicast, it, too, can re-spond with aPRUNEmessage. Inthis way,the spanning tree is recursively pruned.DVMRP(Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol)isanexample of a multi-cast routing protocol that works this way (Waitzman et al., 1988).Pruning results in efficient spanning trees that use only the links that are ac-tually needed to reach members of the group and no others.One potential disad-vantage is that it is lots of work for routers, especially for very big networks. Sup-pose that a network hasngroups, each with an average ofmnodes. Ateach routerand for each groupmpruned spanning trees must be stored, for a total ofmntrees.Forexample, Fig.5-16(c) givesthe spanning tree for the leftmost router to send togroup 1. The spanning tree for the rightmost router to send to group 1 (not shownin the figure) will look quite different, as packets will head directly for group mem-bers rather than via the left side of the graph.This in turn means that routers mustforward packets destined to group 1 in different directions depending on whichnode is sending to the group.When manylarge groups with manysenders exist,considerable storage is needed to store all the trees.An alternative design usescore-based treesto compute a single spanning treefor the group (Ballardie et al., 1993).All of the routers agree on a root (called thecoreorrendezvous point)and build the tree by sending a packet from each mem-ber to the root.The tree is the union of the paths traced by these packets.Fig. 5-17(a)shows a core-based tree for group 1. Tosend to this group, a sendersends a packet to the core. When the packet reaches the core, it is forwarded downthe tree. This is shown in Fig.5-17(b) for the sender on the righthand side of thenetwork. Asaperformance optimization, packets destined for the group do notneed to reach the core before theyare multicast. As soon as a packet reaches thetree, it can be forwarded up toward the root, as well as down all the other branches.This is the case for the sender at the top of Fig. 5-17(b).Having a shared tree is not optimal for all sources. For example, inFig. 5-17(b),the packet from the sender on the righthand side reaches the top-rightgroup member via the core in three hops, instead of directly.The inefficiencyde-pends on where the core and senders are located, but often it is reasonable whenthe core is in the middle of the senders. When there is only a single sender,asinavideo that is streamed to a group, using the sender as the core is optimal.'),\n",

Further,routers that are not part of the tree do no work at all tosupport the group. For this reason, shared tree approaches likecore-based trees areused for multicasting to sparse groups in the Internet as part of popular protocolssuch as protocol independent multicast (Fenner et al., 2006).5.2.9 AnycastRoutingSo far,wehavecovered delivery models in which a source sends to a singledestination (calledunicast), to all destinations (called broadcast), and to a group ofdestinations (called multicast).Another delivery model, calledanycastis some-times also useful.In anycast, apacket is delivered to the nearest member of agroup (Partridge et al., 1993).Schemes that find these paths are calledanycastrouting.Whywould we want anycast? Sometimes nodes provide a service, such as timeof day or content distribution for which it is getting the right information that mat-ters, not the node that is contacted; anynode will do. For example, anycast is usedin the Internet as part of DNS, as we will see in Chap. 7.Fortunately,regular distance vector and link state routing can produce anycastroutes, so we do not need to devise a newrouting scheme for anycast. Suppose wewant to anycast to the members of group 1.Theywill all be giventhe address ‘‘1,’’instead of different addresses.Distance vector routing will distribute vectors asusual, and nodes will choose the shortest path to destination 1.This will result innodes sending to the nearest instance of destination 1. The routes are shown inFig. 5-18(a).This procedure works because the routing protocol does not realizethat there are multiple instances of destination 1.That is, it believesthat all theinstances of node 1 are the same node, as in the topology shown in Fig. 5-18(b).'),\n",

How-ever, link state protocols already makethis distinction between routers and hosts.We glossed overthis fact earlier because it was not needed for our discussion.5.3 TRAFFICMANAGEMENT ATTHE NETWORK LAYERToomanypackets in anypart of the network can ultimately introduce packetdelay and loss that degrades performance.This situation is calledcongestion.5.3.1 TheNeed for Traffic Management: CongestionThe network and transport layers share the responsibility for managing conges-tion. Because congestion occurs within the network, it is the network layer that di-rectly experiences it and must ultimately determine what to do with the excesspackets. Themost effective way to control congestion is to reduce the load that thetransport layer is placing on the network. Thisrequires the network and transportlayers to work together.The network layer does not automatically mitigate con-gestion, but network operators can configure routers, switches, and other devices atthe network layer to mitigate the effects of congestion, typically by taking actionsthat would encourage a sender to reduce the sending rate, or by sending trafficalong different, less-congested paths through the network. Inthis chapter we willlook at the aspects of congestion that concern the network layer,and mechanismsthat the network layer uses to control and manage congestion.To avoid confusionwith the more common use of the phase ‘‘congestion control,’’ which is frequentlyused by some authors to describe functions of the transport layer,inthis chapter we'),\n",

However, asthe offered loadapproaches the carrying capacity,bursts of trafficoccasionally fill up the buffersinside routers and some packets are lost.These lost packets consume some of thecapacity,sothe number of delivered packets falls belowthe ideal curve. Atthispoint, the network is experiencing congestion.Ideal\\nGoodput (packets/sec)DesirableresponseCapacity ofthe networkCongestioncollapse\\nOffered load (packet/sec)\\nOnset ofcongestion\\nFigure5-19.Performance drops significantly in the presence of congestion:packet loss rates increase, and latencyalso increases as router queues fill withpackets.At some point, the network may experience acongestion collapse,where per-formance plummets as the offered load increases beyond the capacity.Inshort,congestion collapse occurs when increasing load on the network actually results inless trafficbeing successfully delivered. Thissituation can occur if packets aresufficiently delayed inside the network that theyare no longer useful when theyleave the network. For example, in the early Internet, the time a packet spent wait-ing for a backlog of packets ahead of it to be sent overaslow56-kbps link couldreach the maximum time it was allowed to remain in the network. It then had to bethrown away. Adifferent failure mode occurs when senders retransmit packets thatare greatly delayed, thinking that theyhavebeen lost.In this case, copies of thesame packet will be delivered by the network, again wasting its capacity.Tocap-ture these factors, the y-axis of Fig.5-19 is givenasgoodput,which is the rate atwhichusefulpackets are delivered by the network.We would liketodesign networks that avoid congestion where possible and donot suffer from congestion collapse if theysomehowdobecome congested.Unfor-tunately,inapacket-switched network, congestion cannot wholly be avoided.

Allof this makes matters worse, not better—it leads to congestion collapse.Low-bandwidth links or routers that process packets more slowly than the ca-pacity of a network link can also become congested.In cases where the networkhas additional capacity in other parts of the network, congestion can be mitigatedby directing some of the trafficawayfrom the bottleneck to other (less congested)parts of the network. Ultimately,however, increasing trafficdemands may result incongestion being pervasive throughout the network. Whenthis occurs, there aretwoapproaches that operators can take: shedding load (i.e., dropping traffic), orprovisioning additional capacity.It is worth pointing out the difference betweencongestion control,trafficmanagement,andflowcontrol,asthe relationship is a subtle one.Trafficman-agement (sometimes also called trafficengineering) has to do with making sure thenetwork is able to carry the offered traffic; it can be performed by devices in thenetwork, or by the senders of traffic(often through mechanisms in the transportprotocol, which are often referred to as congestion control).Congestion manage-ment and control concerns the behavior of all the hosts and routers.Flowcontrol,in contrast, relates to the trafficbetween a particular sender and a particular re-ceiverand is generally concerned with making sure that the sender is not trans-mitting data faster than the receivercan process it.Its job is to makesure no datais lost because the sender is more powerful than the receiverand can send datafaster that the receivercan absorb it.To see the difference between these twoconcepts, consider a network made upof 100-Gbps fiber optic links on which a supercomputer is trying to force feed alarge file to a personal computer that is capable of handling only 1 Gbps.Al-though there is no congestion (the network itself is not in trouble), flowcontrol isneeded to force the supercomputer to stop frequently to give the personal computerachance to breathe.At the other extreme, consider a network with 1-Mbps lines and 1000 largecomputers, half of which are trying to transfer files at 100 kbps to the other half.Here, the problem is not that of fast senders overpowering slowreceivers, but thatthe total offered trafficexceeds what the network can handle.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 416}, page_content='SEC. 5.3TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT ATTHE NETWORK LAYER393The reason congestion control and flowcontrol are often confused is that thebest way to handle both problems is to get the host to slowdown. Thus,ahost canget a ‘‘slow-down’’message either because the receivercannot handle the load orbecause the network cannot handle it.We will come back to this point in Chap. 6.We will start our study of congestion management by looking at the ap-proaches that network operators can apply at different time scales.Then we willlook at approaches that can prevent congestion from occurring in the first place,followed by approaches for coping with it once it has set in.5.3.2 Approaches to Traffic ManagementThe presence of congestion means that the load is (temporarily) greater thanthe resources (in a part of the network) can handle.There are twoapproaches todealing with it: increase the resources or decrease the load.As shown in Fig.5-20,these solutions are usually applied on different time scales to either prevent con-gestion or react to it once it has occurred.Traffic-awareroutingNetworkprovisioningTrafficthrottlingAdmissioncontrolLoadsheddingSlower(Preventative)Faster(Reactive)Figure5-20.Timescales of approaches to trafficand congestion management.The most straightforward way to avoid congestion is to build a network that isprovisioned for the trafficload that it must carry.Ifthere is a low-bandwidth linkon the path along which most trafficisdirected, congestion is likely.Sometimesresources can be added dynamically when there is serious congestion, for example,turning on spare routers or enabling lines that are normally used only as backups(to makethe system fault tolerant) or purchasing bandwidth on the open market.More often, links and routers that are regularly heavily utilized are upgraded at theearliest opportunity.This is calledprovisioningand happens on a time scale ofmonths, drivenbylong-term traffictrends.To makethe most of the existing network capacity,routes can be tailored totrafficpatterns that change during the day as network users wakeand sleep in dif-ferent time zones.Forexample, routes may be changed to shift trafficawayfromheavily used paths by changing the shortest path weights.Some local radio sta-tions have helicopters flying around their cities to report on road congestion tomakeitpossible for their mobile listeners to route their packets (cars) aroundhotspots. Thisis calledtraffic-awarerouting.Splitting trafficacross multiplepaths can also be helpful.However, sometimes it is not possible to increase capacity,especially on shorttime scales.The only way then to beat back the congestion is to decrease the load.'),\n",

The network can request thesesources to slowdownthe sending rates, or it can simply slowdownthe trafficit-self, a process sometimes referred to asthrottling.Two difficulties with this ap-proach are howtoidentify the onset of congestion, and howtoinform the sourcethat needs to slowdown. Totackle the first issue, routers can monitor the averageload, queueing delay,orpacket loss and send feedback to senders, either explicitlyor implicitly (e.g., by dropping packets) to tell them to slowdown.In the case where feedback is explicit, routers must participate in a feedbackloop with the sources.Forascheme to work correctly,the time scale must beadjusted carefully.Ifevery time twopackets arrive inarow,arouter yells STOPand every time a router is idle for 20µ sec, it yells GO, the system will oscillatewildly and neverconverge. Onthe other hand, if it waits 30 minutes to makesurebefore saying anything, the congestion-control mechanism will react too sluggishlyto be of anyuse. Delivering timely feedback is a nontrivial matter.Anadded con-cern is having routers send more messages when the network is already congested.Another approach is for the network to discard packets that it cannot deliver.The general name for this approach is load shedding, and there are various ways toachieve it, including trafficshaping (restricting the transmission rate for a particu-lar sender) and trafficpolicing (dropping trafficfrom a particular sender if itexceeds some rate).Agood policyfor choosing which packets to discard can helpto prevent congestion collapse.We will discuss all of these topics below.Traffic-AwareRoutingThe first approach we will examine is traffic-aware routing.The routing ap-proaches we looked at in Sec.5.2 used fixed link weights that adapted to changesin topology,but not to changes in trafficload. Thegoal in taking load into accountwhen computing routes is to shift trafficawayfrom hotspots that will be the firstplaces in the network to experience congestion.The most direct way to do this is to set the link weight to be a function of the(fixed) link bandwidth and propagation delay plus the (variable) measured load oraverage queueing delay.Least-weight paths will then favorpaths that are morelightly loaded, all else being equal.Traffic-aware routing was used in the early Internet according to this model(Khanna and Zinky, 1989). However, there is a peril.Consider the network ofFig. 5-21,which is divided into twoparts, East and West, connected by twolinks,CFandEI.Suppose that most of the East-West trafficisusing linkCF,resulting'),\n",

In our example this means that the trafficcan be spread across both of the East to West links.The second one is for the rout-ing scheme to shift trafficacross routes slowly enough that it is able to converge, asin the scheme of Gallagher (1977).Giventhese difficulties, in the Internet routing protocols do not generallyadjust their routes depending on the load. Instead, network operators makeadjust-ments to routing protocols on slower time scales by slowly changing the routingconfiguration and parameters, a process sometimes called trafficengineering.Trafficengineering has long been a painstaking, manual process, akin to a blackart. Some work has attempted to formalize this process, but Internet trafficloadsare unpredictable enough, and the protocol configuration parameters are coarse andclunkyenough that the process has remained fairly primitive.More recently,how-ever, the advent of software defined networking has made it possible to automatesome of these tasks, and the increasing use of certain technologies such as MPLStunnels across the network has provided operators with more flexibility for a widerange of trafficengineering tasks.'),\n",

Thisapproach is better than thealternative,asletting more people in when the network is busy just makes mattersworse. Byanalogy,inthe telephone system, when a switch gets overloaded, itpractices admission control by not giving dial tones.The trick with this approach is working out when a newvirtual circuit will leadto congestion.The task is straightforward in the telephone network because of thefixedbandwidth of calls (64 kbps for uncompressed audio).However, virtual cir-cuits in computer networks come in all shapes and sizes.Thus, the circuit mustcome with some characterization of its trafficifweare to apply admission control.Trafficisoften described in terms of its rate and shape.The problem of howtodescribe it in a simple yet meaningful way is difficult because trafficistypicallybursty—the average rate is only half the story.For example, trafficthat varieswhile browsing the Web is more difficult to handle than a streaming movie withthe same long-term throughput because the bursts of Web trafficare more likely tocongest routers in the network. Acommonly used descriptor that captures this ef-fect is the leakybucket or token bucket. Aleakybucket has twoparameters thatbound the average rate and the instantaneous burst size of traffic. Because these aretwocommon mechanisms for performing trafficshaping, we will coverthese top-ics in more detail in that section.Giventrafficdescriptions, the network can decide whether to admit the newvirtual circuit.One possibility is for the network to reserveenough capacity alongthe paths of each of its virtual circuits that congestion will not occur.Inthis case,the trafficdescription is a service agreement for what the network will guaranteeits users. Wehaveprevented congestion but veered into the related topic of qualityof service a little too early; we will return to it shortly.Even without making guarantees, the network can use trafficdescriptions foradmission control.The task is then to estimate howmanycircuits will fit withinthe carrying capacity of the network without congestion.Suppose that virtual cir-cuits that may blast trafficatrates up to 10 Mbps all pass through the same100-Mbps physical link.Howmanycircuits should be admitted? Clearly,10cir-cuits can be admitted without risking congestion, but this is wasteful in the normalcase since it may rarely happen that all 10 are transmitting full blast at the sametime. Inreal networks, measurements of past behavior that capture the statistics oftransmissions can be used to estimate the number of circuits to admit, to trade bet-ter performance for acceptable risk.Admission control can be combined with traffic-aware routing by consideringroutes around traffichotspots as part of the setup procedure.Forexample, consid-er the network of Fig. 5-22(a), in which tworouters are congested, as indicated.'),\n",

(1999) give a design for this kind of load-sensitive routing.Load SheddingWhen none of the above methods makethe congestion disappear,routers canbring out the heavy artillery:load shedding.This is a fancyway of saying thatwhen routers are being inundated by packets that theycannot handle, theyjustthrowthem away. The term comes from the world of electrical power generation,where it refers to the practice of utilities intentionally blacking out certain areas tosave the entire grid from collapsing on hot summer days when the demand forelectricity (to power air conditioners) greatly exceeds the supply.The key question for a router drowning in packets is which packets to drop.The preferred choice may depend on the type of applications that use the network.Forafile transfer,anold packet is worth more than a newone. Thisis becausedropping packet 6 and keeping packets 7 through 10, for example, will only forcethe receivertodomore work to buffer data that it cannot yet use.In contrast, forreal-time media, a newpacket is worth more than an old one.This is becausepackets become useless if theyare delayed and miss the time at which theymust beplayed out to the user.The former policy(old is better than new) is often calledwineand the latter(newisbetter than old) is often calledmilkbecause most people prefer newmilkoverold milk and old wine overnew wine.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 421}, page_content='398 THE NETWORK LAYER CHAP.5More intelligent load shedding requires cooperation from the senders.An ex-ample is packets that carry routing information. These packets are more importantthan regular data packets because theyestablish routes; if theyare lost, the networkmay lose connectivity.Another example is that algorithms for compressing video,likeMPEG, periodically transmit an entire frame and then send subsequent framesas differences from the last full frame.In this case, dropping a packet that is partof a difference is preferable to dropping one that is part of a full frame because fu-ture packets depend on the full frame.To implement an intelligent discard policy, applications must mark their pack-ets to indicate to the network howimportant theyare. Then,when packets have tobe discarded, routers can first drop packets from the least important class, then thenext most important class, and so on.Of course, unless there is some significant incentive toavoid marking everypacket as VERYIMPORTANT—NEVER, EVER DISCARD, nobody will do it.Often accounting and moneyare used to discourage frivolous marking.Forex-ample, the network might let senders transmit faster than the service theypur-chased allows if theymark excess packets as lowpriority.Such a strategy is ac-tually not a bad idea because it makes more efficient use of idle resources, allow-ing hosts to use them as long as nobody else is interested, but without establishingaright to them when times get tough.Traffic ShapingBefore the network can makeperformance guarantees, it must knowwhat traf-ficisbeing guaranteed.In the telephone network, this characterization is simple.Forexample, a voice call (in uncompressed format) needs 64 kbps and consists ofone 8-bit sample every 125µ sec. However, trafficindata networks isbursty.Ittypically arrivesatnonuniform rates as the trafficrate varies (e.g., videoconferenc-ing with compression), users interact with applications (e.g., browsing a newWebpage), and computers switch between tasks.Bursts of trafficare more difficult tohandle than constant-rate trafficbecause theycan fill buffers and cause packets tobe lost.Traffic shapingis a technique for regulating the average rate and burstiness ofaflowofdata that enters the network. The goal is to allowapplications to transmitawide variety of trafficthat suits their needs, including some bursts, yet have asimple and useful way to describe the possible trafficpatterns to the network.When a flowisset up, the user and the network (i.e., the customer and the pro-vider) agree on a certain trafficpattern (i.e., shape) for that flow. Ineffect, the cus-tomer says to the provider ‘‘My transmission pattern will look likethis; can youhandle it?’’Sometimes this agreement is called anSLA(Service LevelAgreement), espe-cially when it is made overaggregate flows and long periods of time, such as all of'),\n",

However, tomakeitwork, there is also the issue of howthe provider cantell if the customer is following the agreement and what to do if the customer isnot. Packets in excess of the agreed pattern might be dropped by the network, ortheymight be marked as having lower priority.Monitoring a trafficflowiscalledtraffic policing.Shaping and policing are not so important for peer-to-peer and other transfersthat will consume anyand all available bandwidth, but theyare of great importancefor real-time data, such as audio and video connections, which have stringent qual-ity-of-service requirements.We havealready seen one way to limit the amount ofdata an application sends: the sliding window, which uses one parameter to limithowmuch data is in transit at anygiventime, which indirectly limits the rate.Nowwe will look at a more general way to characterize traffic, with the leakybucketand token bucket algorithms.The formulations are slightly different but give ane-quivalent result.Trytoimagine a bucket with a small hole in the bottom, as illustrated inFig. 5-23(b).No matter the rate at which water enters the bucket, the outflowisataconstant rate,R,when there is anywater in the bucket and zero when the bucketis empty.Also, once the bucket is full to capacityB,any additional water enteringit spills overthe sides and is lost.\\nCheckbuckethere\\nHostPackets RateRB BRateRTake outwater/tokensPut inwater\\nNetwork(a) (b) (c)Figure5-23.(a) Shaping packets.

Ifapacket arriveswhen the bucket isfull, the packet must either be queued until enough water leaks out to hold it or bediscarded.

Thetap is running at rateRand the bucket has a capacity ofB,asbefore. Nowtosend a packet we must beable to takewater,ortokens, as the contents are commonly called, out of thebucket (rather than putting water into the bucket).

For long intervals, the routers work best at rates not exceeding 200Mbps (say,because this is all the bandwidth giventothe customer).The implica-tion is that if trafficissent in this pattern, some of it will be dropped in the networkbecause it does not fit into the buffers at routers.To avoid this packet loss, we can shape the trafficatthe host with a tokenbucket. If we use a rate,R,of200 Mbps and a capacity,B,of9600 KB, the trafficwill fall within what the network can handle. The output of this token bucket isshown in Fig.5-24(b). Thehost can send full throttle at 1000 Mbps for a shortwhile until it has fully drained the bucket. Then it has to cut back to 200 Mbps un-til the burst has been sent.The effect is to spread out the burst overtime because itwastoo large to handle all at once. The levelofthe token bucket is shown inFig. 5-24(e).It starts offfull and is depleted by the initial burst. Whenit reacheszero, newpackets can be sent only at the rate at which the buffer is filling; therecan be no more bursts until the bucket has recovered. The bucket fills when no traf-ficisbeing sent and stays flat when trafficisbeing sent at the fill rate.We can also shape the traffictobeless bursty.Fig. 5-24(c)shows the output ofatoken bucket withR= 200 Mbps and a capacity of 0. This is the extreme case inwhich the traffichas been completely smoothed. No bursts are allowed, and thetrafficenters the network at a steady rate.The corresponding bucket level, shownin Fig.5-24(f), is always empty.Trafficisbeing queued on the host for release intothe network and there is always a packet waiting to be sent when it is allowed.Finally,Fig. 5-24(d)illustrates the bucket levelfor a token bucket withR= 200 Mbps and a capacity ofB= 16, 000KB. Thisis the smallest token bucketthrough which the trafficpasses unaltered. It might be used at a router in the net-work to police the trafficthat the host sends.However, ifthe host is sending trafficthat conforms to the token bucket on which it has agreed with the network, the traf-ficwill fit through that same token bucket run at the router at the edge of the net-work. If the host sends at a faster or burstier rate, the token bucket will run out ofwater.Ifthis happens, a trafficpolicer will knowthat the trafficisnot as was de-scribed. It will then either drop the excess packets or lower their priority,depend-ing on the design of the network. Inour example, the bucket empties only momen-tarily,atthe end of the initial burst, then recovers enough for the next burst.Leakyand token buckets are easy to implement.We will nowdescribe the op-eration of a token bucket. Even though we have described water flowing continu-ously into and out of the bucket, real implementations must work with discretequantities. Atoken bucket is implemented with a counter for the levelofthebucket. The counter is advanced byR/6 Tunits at every clock tick of6 Tseconds.This would be 200 Kbit every 1 msec in our example above.Every time a unit oftrafficissent into the network, the counter is decremented, and trafficmay be sentuntil the counter reaches zero.When the packets are all the same size, the bucket levelcan just be counted inpackets (e.g., 200 Kbit is 20 packets of 1250 bytes). However, often variable-sizedpackets are used. In this case, the bucket levelcan be counted in bytes. If the'),\n",

Itislonger than just 9600 KB divided by 125 MB/sec becausewhile the burst is being output, more tokens arrive.Ifwecall the burst lengthSsec., the maximum output rateMbytes/sec, the token bucket capacityBbytes, andthe token arrivalrateRbytes/sec, we can see that an output burst contains a maxi-mum ofB+ RSbytes. Wealso knowthat the number of bytes in a maxi-mum-speed burst of lengthSseconds isMS.Hence, we haveB+ RS= MSWe can solvethis equation to getS= B/(M< R). For our parameters ofB= 9600KB,M= 125 MB/sec, andR= 25 MB/sec, we get a burst time of about 94 msec.Apotential problem with the token bucket algorithm is that it reduces largebursts down to the long-term rateR.Itisfrequently desirable to reduce the peakrate, but without going down to the long-term rate (and also without raising thelong-term rate to allowmore trafficinto the network). Onewaytoget smoothertrafficistoinsert a second token bucket after the first one. The rate of the secondbucket should be much higher than the first one. Basically,the first bucket charac-terizes the traffic, fixing its average rate but allowing some bursts. The secondbucket reduces the peak rate at which the bursts are sent into the network. For ex-ample, if the rate of the second token bucket is set to be 500 Mbps and the capacityis set to 0, the initial burst will enter the network at a peak rate of 500 Mbps, whichis lower than the 1000 Mbps rate we had previously.Using all of these buckets can be a bit tricky. When token buckets are used fortrafficshaping at hosts, packets are queued and delayed until the buckets permitthem to be sent. When token buckets are used for trafficpolicing at routers in thenetwork, the algorithm is simulated to makesure that no more packets are sentthan permitted.Nevertheless, these tools provide ways to shape the network trafficinto more manageable forms to assist in meeting quality-of-service requirements.Active Queue ManagementIn the Internet and manyother computer networks, senders adjust their trans-missions to send as much trafficasthe network can readily deliver. Inthis setting,the network aims to operate just before the onset of congestion. When congestionis imminent, it must tell the senders to throttle back their transmissions and slowdown. Thisfeedback is business as usual rather than an exceptional situation. Thetermcongestion avoidanceis sometimes used to contrast this operating point withthe one in which the network has become (overly) congested.Let us nowlook at some approaches to throttling trafficthat can be used inboth datagram networks and virtual-circuit networks alike. Eachapproach mustsolvetwo problems. First, routers must determine when congestion is approaching,'),\n",

Todoso, each router can continuously monitor theresources it is using.Three possibilities are the utilization of the output links, thebuffering of queued packets inside the router,and the number of packets that arelost due to insufficient buffering. Ofthese possibilities, the second one is the mostuseful. Averages of utilization do not directly account for the burstiness of mosttraffic—a utilization of 50% may be lowfor smooth trafficand too high for highlyvariable traffic. Countsof packet losses come too late. Congestion has already setin by the time that packets are lost.The queueing delay inside routers directly captures anycongestion experi-enced by packets. It should be lowmost of time, but will jump when there is aburst of trafficthat generates a backlog.To maintain a good estimate of the queue-ing delay,d,asample of the instantaneous queue length,s,can be made periodical-ly anddupdated according todnew= _ dold+ (1< _ )swhere the constant_ determines howfast the router forgets recent history.This iscalled anEWMA(Exponentially Weighted Moving Average). Itsmoothes outfluctuations and is equivalent to a low-pass filter.Wheneverdmovesabove somepredefined threshold, the router notes the onset of congestion.The second problem is that routers must delivertimely feedback to the sendersthat are causing the congestion.Congestion is experienced in the network, butrelieving congestion requires action on behalf of the senders that are using the net-work. Todeliverfeedback, the router must identify the appropriate senders. Itmust then warn them carefully,without sending manymore packets into the al-ready congested network. Different schemes use different feedback mechanisms,as we will nowdescribe.Random Early DetectionDealing with congestion when it first starts is more effective than letting it gumup the works and then trying to deal with it.This observation leads to an inter-esting twist on load shedding, which is to discard packets before all the bufferspace is really exhausted.The motivation for this idea is that most Internet hosts do not yet get conges-tion signals from routers in the form of an explicit notification. Instead,the onlyreliable indication of congestion that hosts get from the network is packet loss.After all, it is difficult to build a router that does not drop packets when it is com-pletely overloaded. Transport protocols such as TCP are thus hardwired to react toloss as congestion, slowing down the source in response.The reasoning behindthis logic is that TCP was designed for wired networks and wired networks arevery reliable, so lost packets are mostly due to buffer overruns rather than trans-mission errors.Wireless links must recovertransmission errors at the link layer (sotheyare not seen at the network layer) to work well with TCP.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 427}, page_content='404 THE NETWORK LAYER CHAP.5This situation can be exploited to help reduce congestion.By having routersdrop packets early,before the situation has become hopeless, there is time for thesource to takeaction before it is too late.Apopular algorithm for doing this iscalledRED(Random Early Detection)(Floyd and Jacobson, 1993).To deter-mine when to start discarding, routers maintain a running average of their queuelengths. Whenthe average queue length on some link exceeds a threshold, the linkis said to be congested and a small fraction of the packets are dropped at random.Picking packets at random makes it more likely that the fastest senders will see apacket drop; this is the best option since the router cannot tell which source iscausing the most trouble in a datagram network. Theaffected sender will noticethe loss when there is no acknowledgement, and then the transport protocol willslowdown. Thelost packet is thus delivering the same message as a notificationpacket, but implicitly,without the router sending anyexplicit signal.RED routers improve performance compared to routers that drop packets onlywhen their buffers are full, though theyrequire tuning to work well. For example,the ideal number of packets to drop depends on howmanysenders need to be noti-fied of congestion.However, explicit notification is the better option if it is avail-able. Itworks in exactly the same manner,but delivers a congestion signal expli-citly rather than as a loss; RED is used when hosts cannot receive explicit signals.ChokePacketsThe most direct way to notify a sender of congestion is to tell it directly.Inthis approach, the router selects a congested packet and sends achokepacketbackto the source host, giving it the destination found in the packet. Theoriginal pack-et may be tagged (a header bit is turned on) so that it will not generate anymorechokepackets farther along the path and then forwarded in the usual way.Toavoidincreasing load on the network during a time of congestion, the router may onlysend chokepackets at a lowrate.When the source host gets the chokepacket, it is required to reduce the trafficsent to the specified destination, for example, by 50%.In a datagram network,simply picking packets at random when there is congestion is likely to cause chokepackets to be sent to fast senders, because theywill have the most packets in thequeue. Thefeedback created by this protocol can help prevent congestion yet notthrottle anysender unless it causes trouble.Forthe same reason, it is likely thatmultiple chokepackets will be sent to a givenhost and destination.The hostshould ignore these additional chokes for the fixed time interval until its reductionin traffictakes effect. Afterthat period, further chokepackets indicate that the net-work is still congested.Achokepacket used in the early Internet is theSOURCE QUENCHmessage(Postel, 1981).It nevercaught on, though, partly because the circumstances inwhich it was generated and the effect it had were not well specified. ThemodernInternet uses a different notification design that we will describe next.'),\n",

The sender can then throttle its transmissions as before.This design is calledECN(Explicit Congestion Notification)and is used inthe Internet (Ramakrishnan et al., 2001).It is a refinement of early congestion sig-naling protocols, notably the binary feedback scheme of Ramakrishnan and Jain(1988) that was used in the DECnet architecture.Twobits in the IP packet headerare used to record whether the packet has experienced congestion.Packets areunmarked when theyare sent, as illustrated in Fig.5-25. Ifanyofthe routers theypass through is congested, that router will then mark the packet as having experi-enced congestion as it is forwarded. Thedestination will then echo anymarks ithas receivedback to the sender as an explicit congestion signal in its next replypacket. Thisis shown with a dashed line in the figure to indicate that it happensabove the IP level(e.g., in TCP).The sender must then throttle its transmissions,as in the case of chokepackets.\\nCongestion signalHost\\nMarkedpacketHost\\nPacketCongestedrouter\\nFigure5-25.Explicit congestion notificationHop-by-Hop BackpressureAt high speeds or overlong distances, manynew packets may be transmittedafter congestion has been signaled because of the delay before the signal takes ef-fect.

AnECN indication will takeevenlonger because it is delivered via the destination.Chokepacket propagation is illustrated as the second, third, and fourth steps inFig. 5-26(a).In those 40 msec, another 6.2 megabits will have been sent.Even ifthe host in San Francisco completely shuts down immediately,the 6.2 megabits inthe pipe will continue to pour in and have tobedealt with.Only in the seventhdiagram in Fig. 5-26(a) will the NewYork router notice a slower flow.'),\n",

Theidea is discussed indetail by Mishra et al. (1996).5.4 QUALITY OF SERVICE AND APPLICATION QOEThe techniques we looked at in the previous sections are designed to reducecongestion and improve network performance.However, there are applications(and customers) that demand stronger performance guarantees from the networkthan ‘‘the best that could be done under the circumstances,’’ sometimes referred toasbest effort.Yet, manyapplications often require some minimum levelofthroughput to function and also do not perform well when latencyexceeds somethreshold.. Inthis section, we will continue our study of network performance,with a sharper focus on ways to provide quality of service that can meet applica-tion needs.This is an area in which the Internet is undergoing a long-term up-grade. More recently,there has also been increased focus on user (QoE)Qualityof Experience,which recognizes that ultimately the user experience matters, anddifferent applications have very different requirements and thresholds, as far as net-work performance goes. An increasing area of focus pertains to estimating userQoE giventhe ability to observeonly encrypted network traffic.5.4.1 Application QoS RequirementsAstream of packets from a source to a destination is called aflow(Clark,1988). Aflowmight be all the packets of a connection in a connection-orientednetwork, or all the packets sent from one process to another process in a con-nectionless network. Theneeds of each flowcan be characterized by four primaryparameters: bandwidth, delay,jitter,and loss.Together,these determine theQoS(Quality of Service)the flowrequires.Several common applications and the stringencyoftheir network requirementsare listed in Fig.5-27. Notethat network requirements are less demanding thanapplication requirements in those cases that the application can improve onthe'),\n",

Inparticular,networks do not need to be losslessfor reliable file transfer,and theydonot need to deliverpackets with identicaldelays for audio and video playout. Some amount of loss can be repaired with re-transmissions, and some amount of jitter can be smoothed by buffering packets atthe receiver. However, there is nothing applications can do to remedy the situationif the network provides too little bandwidth or too much delay.Application Bandwidth DelayJitter LossEmail LowLow Low MediumFile sharing HighLowLow MediumWebaccess MediumMedium LowMediumRemote loginLowMedium Medium MediumAudio on demandLowLow High LowVideo on demandHigh LowHigh LowTelephony Low High High LowVideoconferencing HighHigh High LowFigure5-27.Stringencyofapplications’ quality-of-service requirements.The applications differ in their bandwidth needs, with email, audio in allforms, and remote login not needing much, but file sharing and video in all formsneeding a great deal.More interesting are the delay requirements.File transfer applications, includ-ing email and video, are not delay sensitive.Ifall packets are delayed uniformlyby a fewseconds, no harm is done.Interactive applications, such as Web surfingand remote login, are more delay sensitive.Real-time applications, such as tele-phonyand videoconferencing, have strict delay requirements.If all the words in atelephone call are each delayed by too long, the users will find the connectionunacceptable. Onthe other hand, playing audio or video files from a server doesnot require lowdelay.The variation (i.e., standard deviation) in the delay or packet arrivaltimes iscalledjitter.The first three applications in Fig.5-27 are not sensitive tothe pack-ets arriving with irregular time intervals between them.Remote login is somewhatsensitive tothat, since updates on the screen will appear in little bursts if the con-nection suffers much jitter.Video and especially audio are extremely sensitive tojitter.Ifauser is watching a video overthe network and the frames are all delayedby exactly 2.000 seconds, no harm is done.But if the transmission time varies ran-domly between 1 and 2 seconds, the result will be terrible unless the applicationhides the jitter.For audio, a jitter of evenafew milliseconds is clearly audible.The first four applications have more stringent requirements on loss than audioand video because all bits must be delivered correctly.This goal is usuallyachievedwith retransmissions of packets that are lost in the network by the tran-sport layer.This is wasted work; it would be better if the network refused packets'),\n",

Constantbit rate (e.g., telephony).2. Real-timevariable bit rate (e.g., compressed videoconferencing).3. Non-real-timevariable bit rate (e.g., watching a movie on demand).4. Available bit rate (e.g., file transfer).These categories are also useful for other purposes and other networks. Constantbit rate is an attempt to simulate a wire by providing a uniform bandwidth and auniform delay.Variable bit rate occurs when video is compressed, with someframes compressing more than others.Sending a frame with a lot of detail in itmay require sending manybits, whereas a shot of a white wall may compress ex-tremely well.Movies on demand are not actually real time because a fewsecondsof video can easily be buffered at the receiverbefore playback starts, so jitter onthe network merely causes the amount of stored-but-not-played video to vary.Available bit rate is for applications such as email that are not sensitive todelay orjitter and will takewhat bandwidth theycan get.5.4.2 OverprovisioningAn easy solution to provide good quality of service is to build a network withenough capacity for whatevertrafficwill be thrown at it. The name for this solutionisoverprovisioning.The resulting network will carry application trafficwithoutsignificant loss and, assuming a decent routing scheme, will deliverpackets withlowlatency. Performance doesn’tget anybetter than this.To some extent, thetelephone system is overprovisioned because it is rare to pick up a telephone andnot get a dial tone instantly.There is simply so much capacity available that de-mand can almost always be met.The trouble with this solution is that it is expensive.Itisbasically solving aproblem by throwing moneyatit. Qualityof service mechanisms let a networkwith less capacity meet application requirements just as well at a lower cost.Moreover, overprovisioning is based on expected traffic. Allbets are offifthe traf-ficpattern changes too much.With quality of service mechanisms, the networkcan honor the performance guarantees that it makes evenwhen trafficspikes, at thecost of turning down some requests.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 433}, page_content='410 THE NETWORK LAYER CHAP.5Four issues must be addressed to ensure quality of service:1. Whatapplications need from the network.2. Howtoregulate the trafficthat enters the network.3. Howtoreserveresources at routers to guarantee performance.4. Whetherthe network can safely accept more traffic.No single technique deals efficiently with all these issues.Instead, a variety oftechniques have been developed for use at the network (and transport) layer.Prac-tical quality-of-service solutions combine multiple techniques.To this end, wewill describe twoversions of quality of service for the Internet called IntegratedServices and Differentiated Services.5.4.3 Packet SchedulingBeing able to regulate the shape of the offered trafficisagood start.However,to provide a performance guarantee, we must reservesufficient resources along theroute that the packets takethrough the network. Todothis, we are assuming thatthe packets of a flowfollowthe same route.Spraying them overrouters at randommakes it hard to guarantee anything. Asaconsequence, something similar to a vir-tual circuit has to be set up from the source to the destination, and all the packetsthat belong to the flowmust followthis route.Algorithms that allocate router resources among the packets of a flowand be-tween competing flows are calledpacket scheduling algorithms.Three differentkinds of resources can potentially be reserved for different flows:1. Bandwidth.2. Buffer space.3. CPUcycles.The first one, bandwidth, is the most obvious. Ifaflowrequires 1 Mbps and theoutgoing line has a capacity of 2 Mbps, trying to direct three flows through thatline is not going to work. Thus,reserving bandwidth means not oversubscribinganyoutput line.Asecond resource that is often in short supply is buffer space.When a packetarrives, it is buffered inside the router until it can be transmitted on the chosen out-going line.The purpose of the buffer is to absorb small bursts of trafficastheflows contend with each other.Ifnobuffer is available, the packet has to be dis-carded since there is no place to put it.Forgood quality of service, some buffersmight be reserved for a specific flowsothat flowdoes not have tocompete forbuffers with other flows. Upto some maximum value, there will always be a buff-er available when the flowneeds one.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 434}, page_content='SEC. 5.4QUALITY OF SERVICE AND APPLICATION QOE 411Finally,CPU cycles may also be a scarce resource.It takes router CPU time toprocess a packet, so a router can process only a certain number of packets per sec-ond. Whilemodern routers are able to process most packets quickly,some kindsof packets require greater CPU processing, such as the ICMP packets we will de-scribe in Sec.5.7.4. Makingsure that the CPU is not overloaded is needed toensure timely processing of these packets.First-In First-Out (FIFO) SchedulingPacket scheduling algorithms allocate bandwidth and other router resources bydetermining which of the buffered packets to send on the output line next. Weal-ready described the most straightforward scheduler when explaining howrouterswork. Eachrouter buffers packets in a queue for each output line until theycan besent, and theyare sent in the same order that theyarrived. Thisalgorithm is knownasFIFO(First-In First-Out), or equivalentlyFCFS(First-Come First-Served).FIFO routers usually drop newly arriving packets when the queue is full. Sincethe newly arrivedpacket would have been placed at the end of the queue, this be-havior is calledtail drop.Itisintuitive,and you may be wondering what alterna-tivesexist. Infact, the RED algorithm we described in Sec.5.3.2 chose a newly ar-riving packet to drop at random when the average queue length grewlarge. Theother scheduling algorithms that we will describe also create other opportunitiesfor deciding which packet to drop when the buffers are full.Fair QueueingFIFO scheduling is simple to implement, but it is not suited to providing goodquality of service because when there are multiple flows, one flowcan easily affectthe performance of the other flows. Ifthe first flowisaggressive and sends largebursts of packets, theywill lodge in the queue.Processing packets in the order oftheir arrivalmeans that the aggressive sender can hog most of the capacity of therouters its packets traverse, starving the other flows and reducing their quality ofservice. Toadd insult to injury,the packets of the other flows that do get throughare likely to be delayed because theyhad to sit in the queue behind manypacketsfrom the aggressive sender.Manypacket scheduling algorithms have been devised that provide strongerisolation between flows and thwart attempts at interference (Bhatti and Crowcroft,2000). Oneof the first ones was thefair queueingalgorithm devised by Nagle(1987). Theessence of this algorithm is that routers have separate queues, one foreach flowfor a givenoutput line.When the line becomes idle, the router scans thequeues round robin, as shown in Fig.5-28. Itthen takes the first packet on the nextqueue. Inthis way,withnhosts competing for the output line, each host gets tosend one out of everynpackets. Itis fair in the sense that all flows get to sendpackets at the same rate.Sending more packets will not improve this rate.'),\n",

Demerset al. (1990)suggested an improvement in which the round robin is done in such a way as tosimulate a byte-by-byte round robin, instead of a packet-by-packet round robin.The trick is to compute a virtual time that is the number of the round at which eachpacket would finish being sent. Each round drains a byte from all of the queuesthat have data to send.The packets are then sorted in order of their finishing timesand sent in that order.This algorithm and an example of finish times for packets arriving in threeflows are illustrated in Fig.5-29.

Because packets are sent in their entirety,fair queueing is only an approximation of the ideal byte-by-byte scheme. But it is avery good approximation, staying within one packet transmission of the idealscheme at all times.Weighted Fair QueueingOne shortcoming of this algorithm in practice is that it givesall hosts the samepriority.Inmanysituations, it is desirable to give,for example, video servers morebandwidth than, say,file servers. Thisis easily possible by giving the video servertwoormore bytes per round.This modified algorithm is calledWFQ(WeightedFair Queueing). Lettingthe number of bytes per round be the weight of a flow,W,wecan nowgivethe formula for computing the finish time:Fi= max(Ai,Fi< 1)+ Li/WwhereAiis the arrivaltime,Fiis the finish time, andLiis the length of packeti.The bottom queue of Fig.5-29(a) has a weight of 2, so its packets are sent morequickly as you can see in the finish times giveninFig. 5-29(b).Another practical consideration is implementation complexity.WFQ requiresthat packets be inserted by their finish time into a sorted queue. WithNflows, thisis at best anO(logN)operation per packet, which is difficult to achieve for manyflows in high-speed routers.Shreedhar and Varghese (1995) describe an approxi-mation calleddeficit round robinthat can be implemented very efficiently,withonlyO(1) operations per packet. WFQ is widely used giventhis approximation.Other kinds of scheduling algorithms exist, too.Asimple example is priorityscheduling, in which each packet is marked with a priority.High-priority packetsare always sent before anylow-priority packets that are buffered. Within a priority,packets are sent in FIFO order.However, priority scheduling has the disadvantagethat a burst of high-priority packets can starvelow-priority packets, which mayhave towait indefinitely.WFQ often provides a better alternative.Bygiving thehigh-priority queue a large weight, say 3, high-priority packets will often gothrough a short line (as relatively fewpackets should be high priority) yet somefraction of low-priority packets will continue to be sent evenwhen there is highpriority traffic. Ahigh- and low-priority system is essentially a two-queue WFQsystem in which the high priority has infinite weight.As a final example of a scheduler,packets might carry timestamps and be sentin timestamp order.Clark et al. (1992) describe a design in which the timestamprecords howfar the packet is behind or ahead of schedule as it is sent through a se-quence of routers on the path.Packets that have been queued behind other packetsat a router will tend to be behind schedule, and the packets that have been servicedfirst will tend to be ahead of schedule.Sending packets in order of their time-stamps has the beneficial effect of speeding up slowpackets while at the same time'),\n",

Theresult is that all packets are delivered by the net-work with a more consistent delay,which is obviously a good thing.Putting it TogetherWe havenowseen all the necessary elements for QoS, so it is time to put themtogether to actually provide it.QoS guarantees are established through the processof admission control.We first sawadmission control used to control congestion,which is a performance guarantee, albeit a weak one.The guarantees we are con-sidering noware stronger,but the model is the same.The user offers a flowwithan accompanying QoS requirement to the network. The network then decideswhether to accept or reject the flowbased on its capacity and the commitments ithas made to other flows. Ifit accepts, the network reserves capacity in advance atrouters to guarantee QoS when trafficissent on the newflow.The reservations must be made at all of the routers along the route that thepackets takethrough the network. Anyrouters on the path without reservationsmight become congested, and a single congested router can break the QoS guaran-tee. Manyrouting algorithms find the single best path between each source andeach destination and send all trafficoverthat path.This may cause some flows tobe rejected if there is not enough spare capacity along the best path.QoS guaran-tees for newflows may still be accommodated by choosing a different route for theflowthat has excess capacity.This is calledQoS routing.Chen and Nahrstedt(1998) give anoverviewofthese techniques.It is also possible to split the trafficfor each destination overmultiple paths to more easily find excess capacity.Asimple method is for routers to choose equal-cost paths and to divide the trafficequally or in proportion to the capacity of the outgoing links.However, moresophisticated algorithms are also available (Nelakuditi and Zhang, 2002).Givenapath, the decision to accept or reject a flowisnot a simple matter ofcomparing the resources (bandwidth, buffers, and cycles) requested by the flowwith the router’sexcess capacity in those three dimensions.It is a little more com-plicated than that.To start with, although some applications may knowabout theirbandwidth requirements, fewknowabout buffers or CPU cycles, so at the mini-mum, a different way is needed to describe flows and translate this description torouter resources. Wewill get to this shortly.Next, some applications are far more tolerant of an occasional missed deadlinethan others.The applications must choose from the type of guarantees that the net-work can make, whether hard guarantees or behavior that will hold most of thetime. Allelse being equal, everyone would likehard guarantees, but the difficultyis that theyare expensive because theyconstrain worst case behavior.Guaranteesfor most of the packets are often sufficient for applications, and more flows withthis guarantee can be supported for a fixed capacity.Finally,some applications may be willing to haggle about the flowparametersand others may not be willing to do so.Forexample, a movie viewer that normally'),\n",

Aset of such pa-rameters is called aflowspecification.Typically,the sender (e.g., the video ser-ver) produces a flowspecification proposing the parameters it would liketouse.As the specification propagates along the route, each router examines it and modi-fies the parameters as need be.The modifications can only reduce the flow, not in-crease it (e.g., a lower data rate, not a higher one).When it gets to the other end,the parameters can be established.As an example of what can be in a flowspecification, consider the example ofFig. 5-30.This is based on RFC 2210 and RFC 2211 for Integrated Services, aQoS design we will coverinthe next section.It has fiveparameters. Thefirst twoparameters, thetoken bucketrateandtoken bucketsize,use a token bucket to givethe maximum sustained rate the sender may transmit, averaged overalong time in-terval, and the largest burst it can send overashort time interval.Parameter UnitTokenbucketrate Bytes/secTokenbucketsizeBytesPeak data rate Bytes/secMinimum packetsizeBytesMaximum packetsizeBytesFigure5-30.An example flowspecification.The third parameter,thepeak data rate,isthe maximum transmission rate tol-erated, evenfor brief time intervals. Thesender must neverexceed this rate evenfor short bursts.The last twoparameters specify the minimum and maximum packet sizes, in-cluding the transport and network layer headers (e.g., TCP and IP).The minimumsize is useful because processing each packet takes some fixed time, no matter howshort. Arouter may be prepared to handle 10,000 packets/sec of 1 KB each, butnot be prepared to handle 100,000 packets/sec of 50 bytes each, eventhough thisrepresents a lower data rate.The maximum packet size is important due to internalnetwork limitations that may not be exceeded. For example, if part of the pathgoes overanEthernet, the maximum packet size will be restricted to no more than1500 bytes no matter what the rest of the network can handle.An interesting question is howarouter turns a flowspecification into a set ofspecific resource reservations. Atfirst glance, it might appear that if a router has alink that runs at, say,1Gbps and the average packet is 1000 bits, it can process 1'),\n",

Thisobservation is not the case, though, because there will al-ways be idle periods on the link due to statistical fluctuations in the load.If thelink needs every bit of capacity to get its work done, idling for evenafew bits cre-ates a backlog it can neverget rid of.Even with a load slightly belowthe theoretical capacity,queues can build upand delays can occur.Consider a situation in which packets arrive atrandom withamean arrivalrate ofh packets/sec. The packets have random lengths and can besent on the link with a mean service rate ofµ packets/sec. Underthe assumptionthat both the arrivaland service distributions are Poisson distributions (what is call-ed an M/M/1 queueing system, where ‘‘M’’stands for Markov,i.e., Poisson), it canbe provenusing queueing theory that the mean delay experienced by a packet,T,isT= 1µ × 11< h /µ = 1µ × 11< l wherel = h /µ is the CPU utilization.The first factor,1/µ ,iswhat the servicetime would be in the absence of competition.The second factor is the slowdowndue to competition with other flows. For example, ifh = 950, 000packets/sec andµ = 1, 000, 000packets/sec, thenl = 0. 95and the mean delay experienced byeach packet will be 20µ sec instead of 1µ sec. Thistime accounts for both thequeueing time and the service time, as can be seen when the load is very low(h /µ 5 0). Ifthere are, say,30routers along the flow’sroute, queueing delay alonewill account for 600µ sec of delay.One method of relating flowspecifications to router resources that correspondto bandwidth and delay performance guarantees is givenbyParekh and Gallagher(1993, 1994).It is based on trafficsources shaped by (R,B)token buckets andWFQ at routers.Each flowisgivenaWFQ weightWlarge enough to drain itstoken bucket rateRas shown in Fig.5-31. For example, if the flowhas a rate of 1Mbps and the router and output link have a capacity of 1 Gbps, the weight for theflowmust be greater than 1/1000th of the total of the weights for all of the flows atthat router for the output link.This guarantees the flowaminimum bandwidth.Ifit cannot be givenalarge enough rate, the flowcannot be admitted.\\nWeightedfair queue(R, B)Traffic sourceRouterCapacity CWwi\\nwi\\nW x CR <weights\\nFigure5-31.Bandwidth and delay guarantees with token buckets and WFQ.The largest queueing delay the flowwill see is a function of the burst size ofthe token bucket.

Onthe otherhand, if the trafficissavedupinbursts, then a maximum-size burst,B,may arriveat the router all at once.In this case, the maximum queueing delay,D,will be thetime taken to drain this burst at the guaranteed bandwidth, orB/R(again, ignoringpacketization effects). Ifthis delay is too large, the flowmust request more band-width from the network.These guarantees are hard. The token buckets bound the burstiness of thesource, and fair queueing isolates the bandwidth giventodifferent flows. Thismeans that the flowwill meet its bandwidth and delay guarantees regardless ofhowthe other competing flows behave atthe router.Those other flows cannotbreak the guarantee evenbysaving up trafficand all sending at once.Moreover, the result holds for a path through multiple routers in anynetworktopology.Each flowgets a minimum bandwidth because that bandwidth is guaran-teed at each router.The reason each flowgets a maximum delay is more subtle.Inthe worst case that a burst of traffichits the first router and competes with the traf-ficofother flows, it will be delayed up to the maximum delay ofD.However, thisdelay will also smooth the burst. Inturn, this means that the burst will incur nofurther queueing delays at later routers.The overall queueing delay will be at mostD.5.4.4 IntegratedServicesBetween 1995 and 1997, IETF put a lot of effort into devising an architecturefor streaming multimedia.This work resulted in overtwo dozen RFCs, startingwith RFC 2205 through RFC 2212.The generic name for this work isintegratedservices.Itwas aimed at both unicast and multicast applications.An example ofthe former is a single user streaming a video clip from a news site.An example ofthe latter is a collection of digital television stations broadcasting their programs asstreams of IP packets to manyreceivers at various locations.Belowwewill con-centrate on multicast, since unicast is a special case of multicast.In manymulticast applications, groups can change membership dynamically,for example, as people enter a video conference and then get bored and switch to asoap opera or the croquet channel.Under these conditions, the approach of havingthe senders reservebandwidth in advance does not work well, since it would re-quire each sender to track all entries and exits of its audience.Forasystem de-signed to transmit television with millions of subscribers, it would not work at all.RSVP—The Resource reSerVation ProtocolThe main part of the integrated services architecture that is visible to the usersof the network isRSVP(Resource reSerVation Protocol).

Thestandard multicast routing algo-rithm then builds a spanning tree covering all group members.The routing algo-rithm is not part of RSVP.The only difference from normal multicasting is a littleextra information that is multicast to the group periodically to tell the routers alongthe tree to maintain certain data structures in their memories.As an example, consider the network of Fig.5-32(a).

Ifhost 2 is transmitting several video streams in realtime, for example a TV broadcaster with multiple channels, host 3 may switch be-tween them at will without changing its reservation: the routers do not care whatprogram the receiveriswatching.5.4.5 Differentiated ServicesFlow-based algorithms have the potential to offer good quality of service toone or more flows because theyreservewhateverresources are needed along theroute. However, theyalso have a downside. Theyrequire an advance setup to es-tablish each flow, something that does not scale well when there are thousands ormillions of flows. Also,theymaintain internal per-flowstate in the routers, mak-ing them vulnerable to router crashes.Finally,the changes required to the routercode are substantial and involvecomplexrouter-to-router exchanges for setting upthe flows. Asaconsequence, while work continues to advance integrated services,fewdeployments of it or anything likeitexist yet.Forthese reasons, IETF has also devised a simpler approach to quality of ser-vice, one that can be largely implemented locally in each router without advancesetup and without having the whole path involved. Thisapproach is known asclass-based(as opposed to flow-based) quality of service.IETF has standardizedan architecture for it, calleddifferentiated services,which is described in RFC2474, RFC 2475, and numerous others.We will nowdescribe it.Differentiated services can be offered by a set of routers forming an adminis-trative domain (e.g., an ISP or a telco).The administration defines a set of serviceclasses with corresponding forwarding rules.If a customer subscribes to dif-ferentiated services, customer packets entering the domain are marked with theclass to which theybelong. Thisinformation is carried in theDifferentiated ser-vicesfield of IPv4 and IPv6 packets (described in Sec.5.7.1). Theclasses are de-fined asper-hop behaviorsbecause theycorrespond to the treatment the packetwill receive ateach router,not a guarantee across the network. Betterservice isprovided to packets with some per-hop behaviors (e.g., premium service) than toothers (e.g., regular service).Trafficwithin a class may be required to conform tosome specific shape, such as a leakybucket with some specified drain rate.An op-erator with a good nose for business might charge extra for each premium packettransported or might allowuptoNpremium packets per month for a fixed addi-tional monthly fee.Note that this scheme requires no advance setup, no resource'),\n",

With a flow-based scheme, each telephone call gets its own resources and guarantees.With aclass-based scheme, all the telephone calls together get the resources reserved forthe class telephony. These resources cannot be taken awaybypackets from theWebbrowsing class or other classes, but no telephone call gets anyprivate re-sources reserved for it alone.Expedited ForwardingThe choice of service classes is up to each operator,but since packets are oftenforwarded between networks run by different operators, IETF has defined somenetwork-independent service classes.The simplest class isexpedited forwarding,so let us start with that one.It is described in RFC 3246.The idea behind expedited forwarding is very simple.Twoclasses of serviceare available: regular and expedited. Thevast majority of the trafficisexpected tobe regular,but a limited fraction of the packets are expedited. Theexpedited pack-ets should be able to transit the network as though no other packets were present.In this way,theywill get lowloss, lowdelay and lowjitter service—just what isneeded for VoIP.Asymbolic representation of this ‘‘two-tube’’system is giveninFig. 5-34.Note that there is still just one physical line.The twological pipesshown in the figure represent a way to reservebandwidth for different classes ofservice, not a second physical line.One way to implement this strategy is as follows. Packets are classified asexpedited or regular and marked accordingly.This step might be done on the send-ing host or in the ingress (first) router.The advantage of doing classification on thesending host is that more information is available about which packets belong towhich flows. Thistask may be performed by networking software or eventhe op-erating system, to avoid having to change existing applications.Forexample, it isbecoming common for VoIP packets to be marked for expedited service by hosts.If the packets pass through a corporate network or ISP that supports expedited ser-vice, theywill receive preferential treatment. If the network does not support expe-dited service, no harm is done. In that case, it makes sense to at least try.'),\n",

Whenapacket arrives, it is queued accordingly.The expedited queue is givenpriority overthe regular one, for example, by using a priority scheduler.Inthisway, expedited packets see an unloaded network, evenwhen there is, in fact, aheavy load of regular traffic.Assured ForwardingAsomewhat more elaborate scheme for managing the service classes is calledassured forwarding.Itisdescribed in RFC 2597.Assured forwarding specifiesthat there shall be four priority classes, each class having its own resources.Thetop three classes might be called gold, silver,and bronze.In addition, it definesthree discard classes for packets that are experiencing congestion: low, medium,and high.Takentogether,these factors define 12 service classes.Figure 5-35 shows one way packets might be processed under assured for-warding. Thefirst step is to classify the packets into one of the four priorityclasses. Asbefore, this step might be done on the sending host (as shown in thefigure) or in the ingress router,and the rate of higher-priority packets may be limit-ed by the operator as part of the service offering.The next step is to determine the discard class for each packet. Thisis done bypassing the packets of each priority class through a trafficpolicer such as a tokenbucket. Thepolicer lets all of the trafficthrough, but it identifies packets that fitwithin small bursts as lowdiscard, packets that exceed small bursts as medium dis-card, and packets that exceed large bursts as high discard.The combination of pri-ority and discard class is then encoded in each packet.Finally,the packets are processed by routers in the network with a packetscheduler that carefully distinguishes the different classes.Acommon choice is to'),\n",

Atthis stage, there is still buffer space with which to accept lowdiscardpackets while dropping high discard packets.5.5 INTERNETWORKINGUntil now, wehaveimplicitly assumed that there is a single homogeneous net-work, with each machine using the same protocol in each layer.Unfortunately,thisassumption is wildly optimistic.Manydifferent networks exist, including PANs,LANs, MANs, and WANs.

Heterogeneity ishere to stay.If there will always be different networks, it would be simpler if we did notneed to interconnect them.This also is very unlikely.Bob Metcalfe postulated thatthe value of a network withNnodes is the number of connections that may bemade between the nodes, orN2(Gilder,1993). Thismeans that large networks arefarmore valuable than small networks because theyallowmanymore connections,so there always will be an incentive tocombine smaller networks.The Internet is the prime example of this interconnection.(Wewill write Inter-net with a capital ‘‘I’’todistinguish it from other internets, or connected net-works.) Thepurpose of joining all these networks is to allowusers on anyofthemto communicate with users on all the other ones.When you pay an ISP for Internetservice, you may be charged depending on the bandwidth of your line, but whatyou are really paying for is the ability to exchange packets with anyother host thatis also connected to the Internet. After all, the Internet would not be very popular ifyou could only send packets to other hosts in the same city.Since networks often differ in important ways, getting packets from one net-work to another is not always so easy.Wemust address problems of heterogeneity,and also problems of scale as the resulting internet grows very large. Wewill be-gin by looking at hownetworks can differ to see what we are up against. Then weshall see the approach used so successfully by IP,the network layer protocol of theInternet, including techniques for tunneling through networks, routing in internet-works, and packet fragmentation.5.5.2 HowNetworks DifferNetworks can differ in manyways.

Thesedifferences will not concern us here.Instead, in Fig.5-36 we listsome of the differences that can be exposed to the network layer.Itispaperingoverthese differences that makes internetworking more difficult than operatingwithin a single network.When packets sent by a source on one network must transit one or more for-eign networks before reaching the destination network, manyproblems can occurat the interfaces between networks. Tostart with, the source needs to be able toaddress the destination. What do we do if the source is on an Ethernet network andthe destination is on the cellular telephone network? Assumingwe can evenspeci-fy a cellular destination from an Ethernet network, packets would cross from aconnectionless network to a connection-oriented one.This may require that a newconnection be set up on short notice, which injects a delay,and much overhead ifthe connection is not used for manymore packets.'),\n",

For example, agatewayjoining twonetworks might generate separate packets for each destinationto simulate multicast. A large packet might be broken up, sent in pieces, and thenjoined back together.Receivers might buffer packets and deliverthem in order.Networks also can differ in large respects that are more difficult to reconcile.The clearest example is quality of service.If one network has strong QoS and theother offers best effort service, it will be impossible to makebandwidth and delayguarantees for real-time trafficend to end.In fact, theycan likely only be madewhile the best-effort network is operated at a lowutilization, or hardly used, whichis unlikely to be the goal of most ISPs.Security mechanisms are problematic, butat least encryption for confidentiality and data integrity can be layered on top ofnetworks that do not already include it.Finally,differences in accounting can leadto unwelcome bills when normal usage suddenly becomes expensive,asroamingmobile phone users with data plans have discovered.5.5.3 ConnectingHeterogeneous NetworksThere are twobasic choices for connecting different networks: we can builddevices that translate or convert packets from each kind of network into packets foreach other network, or as computer scientists often do, we can try to solvethe'),\n",

Ineither case, the devices are placed at the boundaries be-tween networks; initially,these devices were calledgateways.Early on, Cerf and Kahn (1974) argued for a common layer to hide the dif-ferences of existing networks. This approach has been tremendously successful,and the layer theyproposed was eventually separated into the TCP and IP proto-cols. Almostfour decades later,IPisthe foundation of the modern Internet.Forthis accomplishment, Cerf and Kahn were awarded the 2004 Turing Award, infor-mally known as the Nobel Prize of computer science.IP provides a universalpacket format that all routers recognize and that can be passed through almostevery network. IP has extended its reach from computer networks to takeoverthetelephone network. It also runs on sensor networks and other tinydevices that wereonce presumed too resource-constrained to support it.We havediscussed several different devices that connect networks, includingrepeaters, hubs, switches, bridges, routers, and gateways. Repeatersand hubs justmove bits from one wire to another.Theyare mostly analog devices and do notunderstand anything about higher layer protocols. Bridges and switches operate atthe link layer.Theycan be used to build networks, but only with minor protocoltranslation in the process, for example, among 10-, 100-, and 1000-Mbps Ethernetswitches. Ourfocus in this section is interconnection devices that operate at thenetwork layer,namely the routers.We will leave gateways, which are higher-layerinterconnection devices, until later.Let us first explore at a high levelhow interconnection with a common net-work layer can be used to interconnect dissimilar networks. Aninternet comprisedof 802.11, MPLS, and Ethernet networks is shown in Fig.5-37(a). Supposethatthe source machine on the 802.11 network wants to send a packet to the destinationmachine on the Ethernet network. Since these technologies are different, and theyare further separated by another kind of network (MPLS), some added processingis needed at the boundaries between the networks.Because different networks may,ingeneral, have different forms of ad-dressing, the packet carries a network layer address that can identify anyhostacross the three networks. Thefirst boundary the packet reaches is when it tran-sitions from an 802.11 network to an MPLS network. Remember,802.11 providesaconnectionless service, but MPLS provides a connection-oriented service. Thismeans that a virtual circuit must be set up to cross that network. Oncethe packethas traveled along the virtual circuit, it will reach the Ethernet network. Atthisboundary,the packet may be too large to be carried, since 802.11 can work withlarger frames than Ethernet.To handle this problem, the packet is divided intofragments, and each fragment is sent separately.When the fragments reach thedestination, theyare reassembled. Then the packet has completed its journey.The protocol processing for this journeyisshown in Fig.5-37(b). Thesourceaccepts data from the transport layer and generates a packet with the common net-work layer header,which is IP in this example. The network header contains the'),\n",

The routernowexamines the IP address in the packet and looks up this address in its routingtable. Basedon this address, it decides to send the packet to the second routernext. For this part of the path, an MPLS virtual circuit must be established to thesecond router and the packet must be encapsulated with MPLS headers that travelthis circuit. At the far end, the MPLS header is discarded and the network addressis again consulted to find the next network layer hop. It is the destination itself.When a packet is too long to be sent overEthernet, it is split into twoportions.Each of these portions is put into the data field of an Ethernet frame and sent to theEthernet address of the destination.At the destination, the Ethernet header isstripped from each of the frames, and the contents are reassembled.The packethas finally reached its destination.Observethat there is an essential difference between the routed case and theswitched (or bridged) case.With a router,the packet is extracted from the frameand the network address in the packet is used for deciding where to send it.With aswitch (or bridge), the entire frame is transported on the basis of its MACaddress.Switches do not have tounderstand the network layer protocol being used toswitch packets. Routers do.Unfortunately,internetworking is not nearly as easy as we have made it sound.In fact, when bridges were introduced, it was intended that theywould join dif-ferent types of networks, or at least different types of LANs. Theywere to do thisby translating frames from one LAN into frames from another LAN.However,this did not work well, for exactly the same reason that internetworking is difficult:'),\n",

Gettingeverybody to agree on a single format is dif-ficult when companies perceive ittotheir commercial advantage to have a propri-etary format that theycontrol. Examplesbesides IP,which is nowthe near-univer-sal network protocol, were IPX, SNA, and AppleTalk. Noneof these protocols arestill in widespread use, but there will always be other protocols.The most relevantexample nowisprobably IPv4 and IPv6. While these are both versions of IP,theyare not compatible (or it would not have been necessary to create IPv6).Arouter that can handle multiple network protocols is called amultiprotocolrouter.Itmust either translate the protocols, or leave connection for a higher pro-tocol layer.Neither approach is entirely satisfactory.Connection at a higher layer,say,byusing TCP,requires that all the networks implement TCP (which may notbe the case). Then it limits usage across the networks to applications that use TCP(which does not include manyreal-time applications).The alternative istotranslate packets between the networks. However, unlessthe packet formats are close relativeswith the same information fields, such con-versions will always be incomplete and often doomed to failure. For example,IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long.Theywill not fit in a 32-bit IPv4 address field,no matter howhard the router tries. Getting IPv4 and IPv6 to run in the same net-work has proventobeamajor obstacle to the deployment of IPv6.(Tobefair,sohas getting customers to understand whytheyshould want IPv6 in the first place.)Greater problems can be expected when translating between very different proto-cols, such as connectionless and connection-oriented network protocols.Giventhese difficulties, conversion is only rarely attempted.Arguably,evenIPhas onlyworked so well by serving as a kind of lowest common denominator.Itrequires lit-tle of the networks on which it runs, but offers only best-effort service as a result.5.5.4 ConnectingEndpoints Across Heterogeneous NetworksHandling the general case of making twodifferent networks interwork isexceedingly difficult. However, there is a common special case that is manageableevenfor different network protocols.This case is where the source and destinationhosts are on the same type of network, but there is a different network in between.As an example, think of an international bank with an IPv6 network in Paris, anIPv6 network in London, and connectivity between the offices via the IPv4 Inter-net. Thissituation is shown in Fig. 5-38.The solution to this problem is a technique calledtunneling.Tosend an IPpacket to a host in the London office, a host in the Paris office constructs the'),\n",

Whenthis wrappedpacket arrives, the London router removesthe original IPv6 packet and sends itonward to the destination host.The path through the IPv4 Internet can be seen as a big tunnel extending fromone multiprotocol router to the other.The IPv6 packet just travels from one end ofthe tunnel to the other,snug in its nice box.It does not have toworry about deal-ing with IPv4 at all.Neither do the hosts in Paris or London.Only the multiproto-col routers have tounderstand both IPv4 and IPv6 packets. Ineffect, the entire tripfrom one multiprotocol router to the other is likeahop overasingle link.An analogy may maketunneling clearer.Consider a person driving her carfrom Paris to London.Within France, the car movesunder its own power,butwhen it hits the English Channel, it is loaded onto a high-speed train and tran-sported to England through the Chunnel (cars are not permitted to drive throughthe Chunnel).Effectively,the car is being carried as freight, as depicted inFig. 5-39.At the far end, the car is let loose on the English roads and once againcontinues to move under its own power.Tunneling of packets through a foreignnetwork works the same way.Tunneling is widely used to connect isolated hosts and networks using othernetworks. The network that results is called anoverlaysince it has effectively beenoverlaid on the base network. Deployment of a network protocol with a newfea-ture is a common reason, as our ‘‘IPv6 overIPv4’’example shows. Thedisadvan-tage of tunneling is that none of the hosts on the network that is tunneled overcanbe reached because the packets cannot escape in the middle of the tunnel.Howev-er,this limitation of tunnels is turned into an advantage withVPNs(Virtual Pri-vate Networks). AVPN is simply an overlay that is used to provide a measure ofsecurity.Wewill explore VPNs when we get to Chap. 8.'),\n",

Since link state algorithms needto knowthe topology but distance vector algorithms do not, this difference alonewould makeitunclear howtofind the shortest paths across the internet.Networks run by different operators lead to bigger problems. First, the opera-tors may have different ideas about what is a good path through the network. Oneoperator may want the route with the least delay,while another may want the mostinexpensive route. Thiswill lead the operators to use different quantities to set theshortest-path costs (e.g., milliseconds of delay vs.monetary cost). The weightswill not be comparable across networks, so shortest paths on the internet will notbe well defined.Worse yet, one operator may not want another operator to evenknowthe de-tails of the paths in its network, perhaps because the weights and paths may reflectsensitive information (such as the monetary cost) that represents a competitive bus-iness advantage.Finally,the internet may be much larger than anyofthe networks that com-prise it. It may therefore require routing algorithms that scale well by using a hier-archy, evenifnone of the individual networks need to use a hierarchy.All of these considerations lead to a two-levelrouting algorithm.Within eachnetwork, anintradomainor interior gatewayprotocol is used for routing.(‘‘Gate-way’’isanolder term for ‘‘router.’’) It might be a link state protocol of the kind wehave already described.Across the networks that makeupthe internet, aninterdo-mainor exterior gatewayprotocol is used.The networks may all use differentintradomain protocols, but theymust use the same interdomain protocol.In the In-ternet, the interdomain routing protocol is called Border GatewayProtocol (BGP).We will describe it in Sec. 5.7.7There is one more important term to introduce.Since each network is operatedindependently of all the others, it is often referred to as an AS or Autonomous'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 454}, page_content='SEC. 5.5 INTERNETWORKING 431System. Agood mental model for an AS is an ISP network. Infact, an ISP net-work may be comprised of more than one AS, if it is managed, or,has been ac-quired, as multiple networks. Butthe difference is usually not significant.The twolevels are usually not strictly hierarchical, as highly suboptimal pathsmight result if a large international network and a small regional network wereboth abstracted to be a single network. However, relatively little information aboutroutes within the networks is exposed to find routes across the internetwork. Thishelps to address all of the complications.It improvesscaling and lets operatorsfreely select routes within their own networks using a protocol of their choosing. Italso does not require weights to be compared across networks or expose sensitiveinformation outside of networks.However, wehavesaid little so far about howthe routes across the networks ofthe internet are determined.In the Internet, a large determining factor is the busi-ness arrangements between ISPs. Each ISP may charge or receive moneyfrom theother ISPs for carrying traffic. Anotherfactor is that if internetwork routing re-quires crossing international boundaries, various laws may suddenly come intoplay,such as Sweden’sstrict privacy lawsabout exporting personal data aboutSwedish citizens from Sweden.All of these nontechnical factors are wrapped upin the concept of arouting policythat governs the way autonomous networksselect the routes that theyuse. Wewill return to routing policies when we describeBGP.5.5.6 SupportingDifferent Packet Sizes: Packet FragmentationEach network or link imposes some maximum size on its packets. Theselim-its have various causes, among them1. Hardware (e.g., the size of an Ethernet frame).2. Operatingsystem (e.g., all buffers are 512 bytes).3. Protocols(e.g., the number of bits in the packet length field).4. Compliancewith some (inter)national standard.5. Desireto reduce error-induced retransmissions to some level.6. Desireto prevent one packet from occupying the channel too long.The result of all these factors is that the network designers are not free to chooseanyold maximum packet size theywish. Maximumpayloads for some commontechnologies are 1500 bytes for Ethernet and 2272 bytes for 802.11.IP is moregenerous, allows for packets as big as 65,515 bytes.Hosts usually prefer to transmit large packets because this reduces packet over-heads such as bandwidth wasted on header bytes.An obvious internetworkingproblem appears when a large packet wants to travelthrough a network whose'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 455}, page_content='432 THE NETWORK LAYER CHAP.5maximum packet size is too small. This nuisance has been a persistent issue, andsolutions to it have evolved along with much experience gained on the Internet.One solution is to makesure the problem does not occur in the first place.However, this is easier said than done. A source does not usually knowthe path apacket will takethrough the network to a destination, so it certainly does not knowhowsmall a packet has to be to get there.This packet size is called thePath MTU(Path Maximum Transmission Unit). Even if the source did knowthe pathMTU, packets are routed independently in a connectionless network such as the In-ternet. Thisrouting means that paths may suddenly change, which can unexpect-edly change the path MTU.The alternative solution to the problem is to allowrouters to break up packetsintofragments,sending each fragment as a separate network layer packet. How-ever, asevery parent of a small child knows, converting a large object into smallfragments is considerably easier than the reverse process.(Physicists have evengiventhis effect a name: the second lawofthermodynamics.) Packet-switchingnetworks, too, have trouble putting the fragments back together again.Twoopposing strategies exist for recombining the fragments back into theoriginal packet. Thefirst strategy is to makeall the fragmentation caused by a‘‘small-packet’’network transparent to anysubsequent networks through which thepacket must pass on its way to the ultimate destination. This option is shown inFig. 5-40(a).In this approach, when an oversized packet arrivesatG1,the routerbreaks it up into fragments.Each fragment is addressed to the same exit router,G2,where the pieces are recombined.In this way,passage through the small-pack-et network is made transparent.Subsequent networks are not evenaware that frag-mentation has occurred.Transparent fragmentation is straightforward but has some problems.Foronething, the exit router must knowwhen it has receivedall the pieces, so either acount field or an ‘‘end-of-packet’’bit must be provided. Also,because all packetsmust exit via the same router so that theycan be reassembled, the routes are con-strained. Bynot allowing some fragments to followone route to the ultimate desti-nation and other fragments a disjoint route, some performance may be lost.Moresignificant is the amount of work that the router may have todo. It may need tobuffer the fragments as theyarrive,and decide when to throwthem awayifnot allof the fragments arrive.Some of this work may be wasteful, too, as the packetmay pass through a series of small-packet networks and need to be repeatedly frag-mented and reassembled.The other fragmentation strategy is to refrain from recombining fragments atanyintermediate routers.Once a packet has been fragmented, each fragment istreated as though it were an original packet. Therouters pass the fragments, asshown in Fig. 5-40(b), and reassembly is performed only at the destination host.The main advantage of nontransparent fragmentation is that it requires routersto do less work. IP works this way.Acomplete design requires that the fragmentsbe numbered in such a way that the original data stream can be reconstructed.The'),\n",

(b) Nontransparent fragmentation.design used by IP is to give every fragment a packet number (carried on all pack-ets), an absolute byte offset within the packet, and a flag indicating whether it isthe end of the packet. Anexample is shown in Fig.5-41. Whilesimple, this de-sign has some attractive properties. Fragmentscan be placed in a buffer at thedestination in the right place for reassembly,eveniftheyarrive out of order.Frag-ments can also be fragmented if theypass overanetwork with a yet smaller MTU.This is shown in Fig.5-41(c). Retransmissionsof the packet (if all fragments werenot received) can be fragmented into different pieces.Finally,fragments can be ofarbitrary size, down to a single byte plus the packet header.Inall cases, the desti-nation simply uses the packet number and fragment offset to place the data in theright position, and the end-of-packet flag to determine when it has the completepacket.Unfortunately,this design still has problems.The overhead can be higher thanwith transparent fragmentation because fragment headers are nowcarried oversome links where theymay not be needed. But the real problem is the existence offragments in the first place.Kent and Mogul (1987) argued that fragmentation isdetrimental to performance because, as well as the header overheads, a wholepacket is lost if anyofits fragments are lost, and because fragmentation is more ofaburden for hosts than was originally realized.This leads us back to the original solution of getting rid of fragmentation in thenetwork—the strategy used in the modern Internet. The process is calledpathMTU discovery(Mogul and Deering, 1990).It works likethis. EachIP packet issent with its header bits set to indicate that no fragmentation is allowed to be per-formed.

More than one round-trip delay may be needed toprobe the path and find the MTU before anydata is delivered to the destination.This begs the question of whether there are better designs.The answer is probably‘‘Yes.’’ Consider the design in which each router simply truncates packets thatexceed its MTU. This would ensure that the destination learns the MTU as rapidlyas possible (from the amount of data that was delivered) and receivessome of thedata.5.6 SOFTWARE-DEFINED NETWORKINGTrafficmanagement and engineering is historically very challenging: it re-quires network operators to tune the configuration parameters of routing protocols,which then re-compute routes. Trafficflows along the newpaths and results in are-balancing of traffic. Unfortunately,the mechanisms for trafficcontrol in thismanner are indirect: changes to routing configuration result in changes to routingboth in the network and between networks, and these protocols can interact inunpredictable ways.SDN(Software-Defined Networking)aims to fix manyofthese problems.We will discuss it below.5.6.1 OverviewIn a certain way,networks have always been ‘‘software defined,’’ inthe sensethat configurable software running on routers is responsible for looking up infor-mation in packets and making forwarding decisions about them. Yet, the softwarethat runs the routing algorithms and implements other logic about packet for-warding was historically vertically integrated with the networking hardware. Anoperator who bought a Cisco or Juniper router was, in some sense, stuck with thesoftware technology that the vendor shipped with the hardware. For example, mak-ing changes to the way OSPF or BGP work was simply not possible. One of themain concepts driving SDN was to recognize that thecontrol plane,the softwareand logic that select routes and decide what to do with forwarding traffic, runsinsoftware and can operate completely separately from thedata plane,the hard-ware-based technology that is responsible for actually performing lookups onpackets and deciding what to do with them.The twoplanes are shown inFig. 5-43.Giventhe architectural separation of the control plane and the data plane, thenext natural logical step is to recognize that the control plane need not run on thenetwork hardware at all!In fact, one common instantiation of SDN involves a'),\n",

That communicationchannel between the high-levelsoftware program and the underlying hardwarecould be anything that the network device understands. One of the first SDN con-trollers used BGP itself as a control plane (Feamster et al., 2003); subsequently,technologies such as OpenFlow, NETCONF,and YANG have emerged as moreflexible ways to communicate control-plane information with network devices. Insome sense, SDN was a re-incarnation of a well-established idea (i.e., centralizedcontrol) at a time when various enablers (open chipset APIs, software control ofdistributed systems) were also at a levelofmaturity to enable the architecturalideas to finally gain a foothold.\\nFigure5-43.Control and data plane separation in SDN.While the technology of SDN continues to rapidly evolve, the central tenet ofthe separation of the data and control planes remains invariant. SDNtechnologyhas evolved overanumber of years; readers who wish to appreciate a completehistory of SDN can read further to appreciate the genesis of this increasingly popu-lar technology (Feamster et al., 2013). Below, wesurvey several of the majortrends in SDN: (1) control overrouting and forwarding (i.e., the technology behindthe control plane); (2) programmable hardware and customizable forwarding (i.e.,the technology that makes the data plane more programmable), and (3) program-mable network telemetry (a network management application that puts the twopieces together and in manyways may be the ‘‘killer app’’for SDN).5.6.2 TheSDN Control Plane: Logically Centralized SoftwareControlOne of the main technical ideas that underlies SDN is a control plane that runsseparately from the routers, often as a single, logically centralized program.

Moretypically,SDNcontrol programs (sometimes called ‘‘controllers’’) are responsible for more of thecontrol logic, such as computing the paths through the network on behalf of therouters, and simply updating the resulting forwarding tables remotely.Early work insoftware-defined networking aimed to makeiteasier for net-work operators to perform trafficengineering tasks by directly controlling theroutes that each router in the network selects, rather than relying on indirect tuningof network configuration parameters. Early incarnations of SDN thus aimed towork within the constraints of existing Internet routing protocols to use them to di-rectly control the routes.One such example was theRCP(Routing Control Plat-form)(Feamster et al., 2003), which was subsequently deployed in backbone net-works to perform trafficload balancing and defend against denial-of-service at-tacks. Subsequentdevelopments included a system called Ethane (Casado et al.,2007), which used centralized software control to authenticate hosts within a net-work. One of the problems with Ethane, however, was that it required customizedswitches to operate, which limited its deployment in practice.After demonstrating these benefits of SDN to network management, networkoperators and vendors begantotakenotice. Additionally,there was a convenientback door to making the switches evenmore flexible through a programmable con-trol plane: manynetwork switches relied on a common Broadcom chipset, whichhad an interface that allowed direct writes into switch memory.Ateam of re-searchers worked with switch vendors to expose this interface to software pro-grams, ultimately developing a protocol calledOpenFlow(McKeown et al, 2008).The OpenFlowprotocol was exposed by manyswitch vendors who were trying tocompete with the dominant incumbent switch vendor,Cisco. Initially,the protocolsupported a very simple interface: writes into a content-addressable memory thatacted as a simplematch-action table.This match-action table allowed a switch toidentify packets that matched one or more fields in the packet header (e.g., MACaddress, IP address) and perform one of a set of possible actions, including for-warding the packet to a specific port, dropping it, or sending it to an off-path soft-ware controller.There were multiple versions of the OpenFlowprotocol standard. An early ver-sion of OpenFlow, version 1.0, had asinglematch-action table, where entries in thetable could refer to either exact matches on combinations of packet header fields(e.g., MACaddress, IP address) or wild-card entries (e.g., an IP address or MACaddress prefix). Later versions of OpenFlow(the most prominent version beingOpenFlow1.3) added more complexoperations, includingchainsof tables, butvery fewvendors everimplemented these standards.Expressing AND and ORconjunctions on these types of matches turned out to be a bit tricky, especially for'),\n",

Inthe end, adoption of some of these technologies was limited: the Open-Flowprotocol gained some traction in large data centers where operators couldhave complete control overthe network. Yet, widespread adoption in wide-areaand enterprise networks provedmore limited because the operations one could per-form in the forward table were so limited.Additionally,manyswitch vendorsneverfully implemented later versions of the standard, making it difficult to deploysolutions that depended on these standards in practice.Ultimately,however, theOpenFlowprotocol left several important legacies: (1) control overanetwork withasingle, centralized software program, permitting coordination across network de-vices and forwarding elements, and (2) the ability to express such control overtheentire network from a single high-levelprogramming language (e.g., Python, Java).Ultimately,OpenFlowturned out to be a very limiting interface. It was not de-signed with flexible network control in mind, but rather was a product of conven-ience: network devices already had TCAM-based lookup tables in their switchesand OpenFlowwas, more than anything, a market-driveninitiative toopen the in-terface to these tables so that external software programs could write to it. It wasn’tlong before networking researchers started to think about whether there was a bet-ter way to design the hardware as well, to allowfor more flexible types of controlin the data plane. The next section discusses the developments in programmablehardware that have ultimately made the switches themselves more programmable.Meanwhile, programmable software control, mostly initially focused on transitand data center networks, is beginning to find its way into cellular networks aswell. For example, the Central Office Re-Architected as a Datacenter (CORD)project aims to develop a 5G network from disaggregated commodity hardwareand open-source software components (Peterson et al., 2019).5.6.3 TheSDN Data Plane: Programmable HardwareRecognizing the limitations of the OpenFlowchipset, a subsequent develop-ment in SDN was to makethe hardware itself programmable.Anumber of devel-opments in programmable hardware, in both network interface cards (NICs) andswitches have made it possible to customize everything from packet format to for-warding behavior.The general architecture is sometimes called aprotocol-independent switcharchitecture.The architecture involves a fixed set of processing pipelines, eachwith memory for match-action tables, some amount of register memory,and sim-ple operations such as addition (Bosshart et al., 2013). The forwarding model isoften referred to asRMT(Reconfigurable Match Tables), a pipeline architecturethat was inspired by RISC architectures.Each stage of the processing pipeline canread information from the packet headers, makemodifications to the values in the'),\n",

The processing pipeline is as shown in Fig.5-44. Thechip architectureincludes a programmable parser,aset of match stages, which have state and canperform arithmetic computations on packets, as well as perform simple forwardingand dropping decisions, and a ‘‘deparser,’’which writes resulting values back intothe packets. Each of the read/modify stages can modify both the state that is main-tained at each stage, plus anypacket metadata (e.g., information about the queuedepth that an individual packet sees).\\nFigure5-44.Reconfigurable match-action pipeline for a programmable data plane.The RMT model also allows for custom packet header formats, thus making itpossible to store additional information, beyond simply that which is in standardprotocol headers, in each packet. RMT makes it possible for a programmer tochange aspects of the hardware data plane, without modifying the hardware itself.The programmer can specify multiple match tables of arbitrary size, subject to anoverall resource limit. It also givesanoperator sufficient flexibility to modify arbi-trary header fields.Modern chipsets, such as the Barefoot Tofino chipset, makeitpossible to per-form protocol-independent custom packet processing on both packet ingress andegress. as shown in Fig.5-45. Theability to perform customized processing onboth ingress and egress makes it possible to perform analytics on queue timings(e.g., howlong individual packets spend in queues), as well as customized encap-sulation and de-encapsulation. It also makes it possible to perform active queuemanagement (e.g., RED) on egress queues, based on metadata that would be avail-able from ingress queues. Ongoing work is investigating ways to exploit this archi-tecture for trafficand congestion management purposes, such as performing fine-grained queue measurements (Chen et al., 2019).This levelofprogrammability has generally provedmost useful in data-centernetworks, whose architectures can benefit from high degrees of customizability.On the other hand, the model does also allowfor some general improvements andfeatures. For example, the model makes it possible for packets to carry informationabout the state of the network itself, allowing for such applications as so-called'),\n",

The software switch offers a range of features, from VLANs to IPv6.The emergence of OVS made it possible for network operators to customize for-warding in data centers, in particular,with OVS running as a switch in the hypervi-sor of servers in data centers.5.6.4 Programmable Network TelemetryOne of the more important benefits of SDN is its ability to support pro-grammable network measurement. For manyyears, network hardware has onlyexposed a limited amount of information about network traffic, such as aggregate'),\n",

On the other hand, support for the capture of every network packetcan also be prohibitive,giventhe amount of storage and bandwidth that would berequired to capture the traffic, as well as the amount of processing that would berequired to analyze the data at a later point. For manyapplications, there is a needto strikeabalance between the granularity of packet traces with the scalability ofIPFIX aggregates This balance is needed to support network management taskssuch as application performance measurement, and for the congestion managementtasks that we discussed earlier.Programmable switch hardware such as that which we discussed in the previ-ous section can enable more flexible telemetry.One trend, for example, is enablingoperators to express queries about network trafficinhigh-levelprogramming lan-guages using frameworks such as MapReduce (Dean and Ghemawat, 2008). Suchaparadigm, originally designed for data processing on large clusters, also naturallylends itself to queries about network traffic, for example, howmanybytes or pack-ets are destined to a givenaddress or port, within a specified time window? Unfor-tunately,programmable switch hardware is not (yet) sophisticated enough to sup-port complexqueries, and as a result, the query may need to be partitioned acrossthe stream processor and the network switch.Various technologies aim to makeitpossible to support this type of query partitioning (Gupta et al., 2019). Open re-search problems involvefiguring out howtoefficiently map high-levelquery con-structs and abstractions to lower-levelswitch hardware and software.One of the final challenges for programmable network telemetry in the comingyears is the increasing pervasiveness of encrypted trafficonthe Internet. On theone hand, encryption improvesprivacy bymaking it difficult for network eaves-droppers to see the contents of user traffic. On the other hand, however, itisalsomore difficult for network operators to manage their networks when theycannotsee the contents of the traffic. One such example concerns tracking the quality ofInternet video streams. In the absence of encryption, the contents of the trafficmakedetails such as the video bitrate and resolution apparent. When the trafficisencrypted, these properties must be indirectly inferred, based on properties of thenetwork trafficthat can be directly observed (e.g., packet interarrivaltimes, bytestransferred). Recent work has explored ways to automatically infer the higher-levelproperties of network application trafficfrom low-levelstatistics (Bronzino et al.,2020). Network operators will ultimately need better models to help infer howconditions such as congestion affect application performance.5.7 THENETWORK LAYER IN THE INTERNETIt is nowtime to discuss the network layer of the Internet in detail. But beforegetting into specifics, it is worth taking a look at the principles that drove its designin the past and made it the success that it is today.All too often, nowadays, people'),\n",

(1984).We will nowsummarize what weconsider to be the top 10 principles (from most important to least important).1.Makesureitworks.Do not finalize the design or standard untilmultiple prototypes have successfully communicated with each other.All too often, designers first write a 1000-page standard, get itapproved, then discoveritisdeeply flawed and does not work. Thentheywrite version 1.1 of the standard.This is not the way to go.2.Keep it simple.When in doubt, use the simplest solution.Williamof Occam stated this principle (Occam’srazor) in the 14th century.Put in modern terms: fight features.If a feature is not absolutely es-sential, leave itout, especially if the same effect can be achievedbycombining other features.3.Makeclear choices.If there are several ways of doing the samething, choose one.Having twoormore ways to do the same thing islooking for trouble.Standards often have multiple options or modesor parameters because several powerful parties insist that their way isbest. Designersshould strongly resist this tendency. Just say no.4.Exploit modularity.This principle leads directly to the idea of hav-ing protocol stacks, each of whose layers is independent of all theother ones.In this way,ifcircumstances require one module or layerto be changed, the other ones will not be affected.5.Expect heterogeneity.Different types of hardware, transmissionfacilities, and applications will occur on anylarge network. Tohand-le them, the network design must be simple, general, and flexible.6.Avoid static options and parameters.If parameters are unavoidable(e.g., maximum packet size), it is best to have the sender and receivernegotiate a value rather than defining fixed choices.7.Look for a good design; it need not be perfect.Often, the de-signers have a good design but it cannot handle some weird specialcase. Ratherthan messing up the design, the designers should gowith the good design and put the burden of working around it on thepeople with the strange requirements.8.Be strict when sending and tolerant when receiving.In otherwords, send only packets that rigorously comply with the standards,butexpect incoming packets that may not be fully conformant and tryto deal with them.'),\n",

Theseare constructed fromhigh-bandwidth lines and fast routers.The biggest of these backbones, to which everyone else connects to reach therest of the Internet, are calledTier 1 networks.Attached to the backbones areISPs (Internet Service Providers) that provide Internet access to homes and busi-nesses, data centers and colocation facilities full of server machines, and regional(mid-level) networks. Thedata centers servemuch of the content that is sent overthe Internet. Attached to the regional networks are more ISPs, LANs at manyuni-versities and companies, and other edge networks.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 467}, page_content='444 THE NETWORK LAYER CHAP.5designed from the beginning with internetworking in mind.Agood way to thinkof the network layer is this: its job is to provide a best-effort (i.e., not guaranteed)waytotransport packets from source to destination, without regard to whetherthese machines are on the same network or whether there are other networks in be-tween them.Communication in the Internet works as follows. Thetransport layer takesdata streams and breaks them up so that theymay be sent as IP packets. Intheory,packets can be up to 64 KB each, but in practice theyare usually not more than1500 bytes (so theyfit in one Ethernet frame).IP routers forward each packetthrough the Internet, along a path from one router to the next, until the destinationis reached.At the destination, the network layer hands the data to the transportlayer,which givesittothe receiving process.When all the pieces finally get to thedestination machine, theyare reassembled by the network layer into the originaldatagram. Thisdatagram is then handed to the transport layer.In the example of Fig.5-46, a packet originating at a host on the home networkhas to traverse four networks and a large number of IP routers before evengettingto the companynetwork on which the destination host is located.This is notunusual in practice, and there are manylonger paths.There is also much redun-dant connectivity in the Internet, with backbones and ISPs connecting to each otherin multiple locations.This means that there are manypossible paths between twohosts. Itis the job of the IP routing protocols to decide which paths to use.5.7.1 TheIP Version 4 ProtocolAn appropriate place to start our study of the network layer in the Internet iswith the format of the IP datagrams themselves. AnIPv4 datagram consists of aheader part and a body or payload part.The header has a 20-byte fixed part and avariable-length optional part.The header format is shown in Fig.5-47. Thebitsare transmitted from left to right and top to bottom, with the high-order bit of theVersionfield going first. (Thisis a ‘‘big-endian’’network byte order.Onlit-tle-endian machines, such as Intel x86 computers, a software conversion is re-quired on both transmission and reception.)In retrospect, little endian would havebeen a better choice, but at the time IP was designed, no one knewitwould cometo dominate computing.TheVersionfield keeps track of which version of the protocol the datagram be-longs to. Version 4 dominates the Internet today,and that is where we have startedour discussion.By including the version at the start of each datagram, it becomespossible to have a transition between versions overalong period of time. In fact,IPv6, the next version of IP,was defined more than a decade ago, yet is only justbeginning to be deployed. Wewill describe it later in this section.Its use willeventually be forced when each of China’salmost 231people has a desktop PC, alaptop, and an IP phone.As an aside on numbering, IPv5 was an experimentalreal-time stream protocol that was neverwidely used.'),\n",

Theminimum value is 5, whichapplies when no options are present.The maximum value of this 4-bit field is 15,which limits the header to 60 bytes, and thus theOptionsfield to 40 bytes.Forsome options, such as one that records the route a packet has taken, 40 bytes is fartoo small, making those options useless.TheDifferentiated servicesfield is one of the fewfields that has changed itsmeaning (slightly) overthe years.Originally,itwas called theType of servicefield. It was and still is intended to distinguish between different classes of service.Various combinations of reliability and speed are possible.Fordigitized voice, fastdelivery beats accurate delivery.For file transfer,error-free transmission is moreimportant than fast transmission.TheType of servicefield provided 3 bits to signalpriority and 3 bits to signal whether a host cared more about delay,throughput, orreliability.However, noone really knewwhat to do with these bits at routers, sotheywere left unused for manyyears. Whendifferentiated services were designed,IETF threwinthe towel and reused this field. Now, the top 6 bits are used to markthe packet with its service class; we described the expedited and assured servicesearlier in this chapter.The bottom 2 bits are used to carry explicit congestion noti-fication information, such as whether the packet has experienced congestion; wedescribed explicit congestion notification as part of congestion control earlier inthis chapter.TheTotal lengthincludes everything in the datagram—both header and data.The maximum length is 65,535 bytes.At present, this upper limit is tolerable, butwith future networks, larger datagrams may be needed.TheIdentificationfield is needed to allowthe destination host to determinewhich packet a newly arrivedfragment belongs to.All the fragments of a packetcontain the sameIdentificationvalue.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 469}, page_content='446 THE NETWORK LAYER CHAP.5Next comes an unused bit, which is surprising, as available real estate in the IPheader is extremely scarce. As an April Fool’sjoke, Bellovin (2003) proposedusing this bit to detect malicious traffic. Thiswould greatly simplify security,aspackets with the ‘‘evil’’bit set would be known to have been sent by attackers andcould just be discarded.Unfortunately,network security is not this simple, but itwasanice try.Then come two1-bit fields related to fragmentation.DFstands for Don’tFragment. Itis an order to the routers not to fragment the packet. Originally,itwasintended to support hosts incapable of putting the pieces back together again.Nowitisused as part of the process to discoverthe path MTU, which is the largestpacket that can travelalong a path without being fragmented.By marking thedatagram with theDFbit, the sender knows it will either arrive inone piece, or anerror message will be returned to the sender.MFstands for More Fragments.All fragments except the last one have this bitset. Itis needed to knowwhen all fragments of a datagram have arrived.TheFragment offsettells where in the current packet this fragment belongs.All fragments except the last one in a datagram must be a multiple of 8 bytes—theelementary fragment unit.Since 13 bits are provided, there is a maximum of 8192fragments per datagram, supporting a maximum packet length up to the limit of theTotal lengthfield. Working together,theIdentification,MF,andFragment offsetfields are used to implement fragmentation as described in Sec. 5.5.6.TheTTL (Time to live)field is a counter used to limit packet lifetimes.It wasoriginally supposed to count time in seconds, allowing a maximum lifetime of 255sec. Itmust be decremented on each hop and is supposed to be decremented multi-ple times when a packet is queued for a long time in a router.Inpractice, it justcounts hops.When it hits zero, the packet is discarded and a warning packet issent back to the source host.This feature prevents packets from wandering aroundforever, something that otherwise might happen if the routing tables everbecomecorrupted.When the network layer has assembled a complete packet, it needs to knowwhat to do with it.TheProtocolfield tells it which transport process to give thepacket to.TCP is one possibility,but so are UDP and some others.The num-bering of protocols is global across the entire Internet.Protocols and other assign-ed numbers were formerly listed in RFC 1700, but nowadays theyare contained inan online database located atwww.iana.org.Since the header carries vital information such as addresses, it rates its ownchecksum for protection, theHeader checksum.The algorithm is to add up all the16-bit halfwords of the header as theyarrive,using one’scomplement arithmetic,and then takethe one’scomplement of the result.Forpurposes of this algorithm,theHeader checksumis assumed to be zero upon arrival. Suchachecksum is use-ful for detecting errors while the packet travels through the network. Notethat itmust be recomputed at each hop because at least one field always changes (theTime to livefield), but tricks can be used to speed up the computation.'),\n",

Itis most useful for system managers who need to send emergencypacketswhen the routing tables have been corrupted, or for making timing or performancemeasurements.TheLoose source routingoption requires the packet to traverse the list of rout-ers specified, in the order specified, but it is allowed to pass through other routerson the way.Normally,this option will provide only a fewrouters, to force a partic-ular path.Forexample, to force a packet from London to Sydneytogowest in-stead of east, this option might specify routers in NewYork, Los Angeles, andHonolulu. Thisoption is most useful when political or economic considerationsdictate passing through or avoiding certain countries.TheRecordrouteoption tells each router along the path to append its IP ad-dress to theOptionsfield. Thisallows system managers to track down bugs in therouting algorithms, like: ‘‘Whyare packets from Houston to Dallas visiting Tokyofirst?’’.

Thisoption, too, is mostly useful for network measurement.Today,IPoptions have fallen out of favor. Manyrouters ignore them or do notprocess them efficiently,shunting them to the side as an uncommon case. That is,theyare only partly supported and theyare rarely used.5.7.2 IPAddressesAdefining feature of IPv4 is its 32-bit addresses.Every host and router on theInternet has an IP address that can be used in theSource addressandDestinationaddressfields of IP packets. Itis important to note that an IP address does not ac-tually refer to a host.It really refers to a network interface, so if a host is on twonetworks, it must have two IPaddresses. However, inpractice, most hosts are onone network and thus have one IP address.In contrast, routers have multiple inter-faces and thus multiple IP addresses.PrefixesIP addresses are hierarchical, unlikeEthernet addresses.Each 32-bit address iscomprised of a variable-length network portion in the top bits and a host portion inthe bottom bits.The network portion has the same value for all hosts on a singlenetwork, such as an Ethernet LAN.This means that a network corresponds to acontiguous block of IP address space. This block is called aprefix.IP addresses are written indotted decimal notation.Inthis format, each ofthe 4 bytes is written in decimal, from 0 to 255.Forexample, the 32-bit hexadeci-mal address 80D00297 is written as 128.208.2.151.Prefixes are written by givingthe lowest IP address in the block and the size of the block. The size is determinedby the number of bits in the network portion; the remaining bits in the host portioncan vary.This means that the size must be a power of two. Byconvention, it iswritten after the prefix IP address as a slash followed by the length in bits of thenetwork portion.In our example, if the prefix contains 28addresses and so leaves24 bits for the network portion, it is written as 128.208.2.0/24.Since the prefix length cannot be inferred from the IP address alone, routingprotocols must carry the prefixes to routers. Sometimes prefixes are simply de-scribed by their length, as in a ‘‘/16’’which is pronounced ‘‘slash 16.’’ The lengthof the prefix corresponds to a binary mask of 1s in the network portion. When writ-ten out this way,itiscalled asubnet mask.Itcan be ANDed with the IP addressto extract only the network portion. For our example, the subnet mask is255.255.255.0. Fig.5-49 shows a prefix and a subnet mask.Hierarchical addresses have significant advantages and disadvantages. Thekeyadvantage of prefixes is that routers can forward packets based on only the net-work portion of the address, as long as each of the networks has a unique addressblock. Thehost portion does not matter at all to the routers because all hosts on'),\n",

Thismakes the routing tables much smaller than theywould otherwise be.Consider that the number of hosts on the Internet is approaching one billion. Thatwould be a very large table for every router to keep. However, byusing a hierarchy,routers need to keep routes for only around 300,000 prefixes.While using a hierarchylets Internet routing scale, it has twodisadvantages.First, the IP address of a host depends on where it is located in the network. AnEthernet address can be used anywhere in the world, but every IP address belongsto a specific network, and routers will only be able to deliverpackets destined tothat address to the network. Designs such as mobile IP are needed to support hoststhat move between networks but want to keep the same IP addresses.The second disadvantage is that the hierarchyiswasteful of addresses unless itis carefully managed.If addresses are assigned to networks in (too) large blocks,there will be (many) addresses that are allocated but not in use. This allocationwould not matter much if there were plenty of addresses to go around. However, itwasrealized more than twodecades ago that the tremendous growth of the Internetwasrapidly depleting the free address space. IPv6 is the solution to this shortage,butuntil it is widely deployed there will be great pressure to allocate IP addressesso that theyare used very efficiently.SubnetsNetwork numbers are managed by a nonprofit corporation calledICANN(Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), to avoid conflicts.In turn, ICANN has delegated parts of the address space to various regional author-ities, which dole out IP addresses to ISPs and other companies.This is the processby which a companyisallocated a block of IP addresses.However, this process is only the start of the story,asIPaddress assignment isongoing as companies grow. Wehavesaid that routing by prefix requires all thehosts in a network to have the same network number.This property can causeproblems as networks grow. For example, let us consider a university that startedout with our example /16 prefix for use by the Computer Science Dept.for the'),\n",

The Art Dept. soon follows suit.What IP addresses shouldthese departments use?Getting further blocks requires going outside the universityand may be expensive orinconvenient. Moreover, the /16 already allocated hasenough addresses for over60,000 hosts.It might be intended to allowfor signifi-cant growth, but until that happens, it is wasteful to allocate further blocks of IPaddresses to the same university.Adifferent organization is required.The solution is to allowthe block of addresses to be split into several parts forinternal use as multiple networks, while still acting likeasingle network to the out-side world. Thisis calledsubnettingand the networks (such as Ethernet LANs)that result from dividing up a larger network are calledsubnets.Aswementionedin Chap. 1, you should be aware that this newusage of the term conflicts witholder usage of ‘‘subnet’’tomean the set of all routers and communication lines in anetwork.Figure 5-50 shows howsubnets can help with our example. Thesingle /16 hasbeen split into pieces. This split does not need to be even, but each piece must bealigned so that anybits can be used in the lower host portion.In this case, half ofthe block (a /17) is allocated to the Computer Science Dept., a quarter is allocatedto the Electrical Engineering Dept.(a /18), and one-eighth (a /19) to the Art Dept.The remaining eighth is unallocated.

Instead, the routers simply need toknowthe subnet masks for the networks on campus.When a packet arrives, the router looks at the destination address of the packetand checks which subnet it belongs to. The router can do this by ANDing the desti-nation address with the mask for each subnet and checking to see if the result is thecorresponding prefix. For example, consider a packet destined for IP address128.208.2.151. Tosee if it is for the Computer Science Dept., we AND with255.255.128.0 to takethe first 17 bits (which is 128.208.0.0) and see if theymatchthe prefix address (which is 128.208.128.0).

This does match the prefix address, so the packet is for-warded onto the interface that leads to the Electrical Engineering network.The subnet divisions can be changed later if necessary,byupdating all subnetmasks at routers inside the university.Outside the network, the subnetting is notvisible, so allocating a newsubnet does not require contacting ICANN or changinganyexternal databases.CIDR—Classless InterDomain RoutingEven if blocks of IP addresses are allocated so that the addresses are used ef-ficiently,there is still a problem that remains: routing table explosion.Routers in organizations at the edge of a network, such as a university,need tohave anentry for each of their subnets, telling the router which line to use to get tothat network. For routes to destinations outside of the organization, theycan usethe simple default rule of sending the packets on the line toward the ISP that con-nects the organization to the rest of the Internet. The other destination addressesmust all be out there somewhere.Routers in ISPs and backbones in the middle of the Internet have nosuch lux-ury.Theymust knowwhich way to go to get to every network and no simple de-fault will work. These core routers are said to be in thedefault-free zoneof theInternet. Noone really knows howmanynetworks are connected to the Internetanymore, but it is a large number,probably at least a million.This can makefor avery large table.It may not sound large by computer standards, but realize thatrouters must perform a lookup in this table to forward every packet, and routers atlarge ISPs may forward up to millions of packets per second.Specialized hard-ware and fast memory are needed to process packets at these rates, not a gener-al-purpose computer.In addition, routing algorithms require each router to exchange informationabout the addresses it can reach with other routers.The larger the tables, the moreinformation needs to be communicated and processed. The processing grows atleast linearly with the table size. Greater communication increases the likelihood'),\n",

For example, having each IP address contain acountry,state/province, city,network, and host field might work. Theneach routerwould only need to knowhow toget to each country,the states or provinces in itsowncountry,the cities in its state or province, and the networks in its city.Unfor-tunately,this solution would require considerably more than 32 bits for IP ad-dresses and would use addresses inefficiently (and Liechtenstein would have asmanybits in its addresses as the United States).Fortunately,there is something we can do to reduce routing table sizes. Wecanapply the same insight as subnetting: routers at different locations can knowaboutagivenIPaddress as belonging to prefixes of different sizes. However, instead ofsplitting an address block into subnets, here we combine multiple small prefixesinto a single larger prefix. This process is calledroute aggregation.The resultinglarger prefix is sometimes called asupernet,tocontrast with subnets as the divis-ion of blocks of addresses.With aggregation, IP addresses are contained in prefixes of varying sizes. Thesame IP address that one router treats as part of a /22 (a block containing 210ad-dresses) may be treated by another router as part of a larger /20 (which contains 212addresses). It is up to each router to have the corresponding prefix information.This design works with subnetting and is calledCIDR(Classless InterDomainRouting), which is pronounced ‘‘cider,’’asinthe drink.The most recent versionof it is specified in RFC 4632 (Fuller and Li, 2006).The name highlights the con-trast with addresses that encode hierarchywith classes, which we will describeshortly.To makeCIDR easier to understand, let us consider an example in which ablock of 8192 IP addresses is available starting at 194.24.0.0.Suppose that Cam-bridge University needs 2048 addresses and is assigned the addresses 194.24.0.0through 194.24.7.255, along with mask 255.255.248.0. This is a /21 prefix. Next,Oxford University asks for 4096 addresses.Since a block of 4096 addresses mustlie exactly on a 4096-byte boundary,Oxford cannot be givenaddresses starting at194.24.8.0. Instead,it gets 194.24.16.0 through 194.24.31.255, along with subnetmask 255.255.240.0.Finally,the University of Edinburgh asks for 1024 addressesand is then assigned addresses 194.24.8.0 through 194.24.11.255 and also mask255.255.252.0. Theseassignments are summarized in Fig. 5-51.All of the routers in the default-free zone are nowtold about the IP addressesin the three networks. Routers close to the universities may need to send on a dif-ferent outgoing line for each of the prefixes, so theyneed an entry for each of theprefixes in their routing tables. An example is the router in London in Fig. 5-52.Nowlet us look at these three universities from the point of viewofadistantrouter in NewYork. All of the IP addresses in the three prefixes should be sentfrom NewYork (or the U.S. in general) to London. The routing process in London'),\n",

Byusing aggregation, three prefixes have been reduced to one, reducingthe prefixes that the NewYork router must be told about and the routing table en-tries in the NewYork router.When aggregation is turned on, it is an automatic process.It depends onwhich prefixes are located where in the Internet not on the actions of an adminis-trator assigning addresses to networks.

Whenapacket comes in, the routingtable is scanned to determine if the destination lies within the prefix. Itis possiblethat multiple entries with different prefix lengths will match, in which case theentry with the longest prefix is used.Thus, if there is a match for a /20 mask and a/24 mask, the /24 entry is used to look up the outgoing line for the packet. Howev-er,this process would be tedious if the table were really scanned entry by entry.Instead, complexalgorithms have been devised to speed up the address matchingprocess (Ruiz-Sanchez et al., 2001).Commercial routers use custom VLSI chipswith these algorithms embedded in hardware.Classful and Special AddressingTo help you better appreciate whyCIDR is so useful, we will briefly relate thedesign that predated it.Before 1993, IP addresses were divided into the fivecate-gories listed in Fig.5-54. Thisallocation has come to be calledclassful address-ing.The class A, B, and C formats allowfor up to 128 networks with 16 millionhosts each, 16,384 networks with up to 65,536 hosts each, and 2 million networks(e.g., LANs) with up to 256 hosts each (although a fewofthese are special).Alsosupported is multicast (the class D format), in which a datagram is directed to mul-tiple hosts.Addresses beginning with 1111 are reserved for use in the future.Theywould be valuable to use nowgiventhe depletion of the IPv4 address space.Unfortunately,manyhosts will not accept these addresses as valid because theyhave been off-limits for so long and it is hard to teach old hosts newtricks.This is a hierarchical design, but unlikeCIDR the sizes of the address blocksare fixed.

For most organizations, a class A network, with 16 million addresses, is toobig, and a class C network, with 256 addresses is too small.Aclass B network,with 65,536, is just right.In Internet folklore, this situation is known as thethreebears problemas inGoldilocks and the Three Bears(Southey, 1848).In reality,though, a class B address is far too large for most organizations.Studies have shown that more than half of all class B networks have fewer than 50hosts. Aclass C network would have done the job, but no doubt every organiza-tion that asked for a class B address thought that one day it would outgrowthe8-bit host field. Inretrospect, it might have been better to have had class C net-works use 10 bits instead of 8 for the host number,allowing 1022 hosts per net-work. Hadthis been the case, most organizations would probably have settled foraclass C network, and there would have been half a million of them (versus only16,384 class B networks).It is hard to fault the Internet’sdesigners for not having provided more (andsmaller) class B addresses.At the time the decision was made to create the threeclasses, the Internet was a research network connecting the major research univer-sities in the U.S.(plus a very small number of companies and military sites doingnetworking research).No one then perceivedthe Internet becoming a mass-marketcommunication system rivaling the telephone network.

Whydidn’ttheyinclude the planet numberin the phone number?’’But at the time, it did not seem necessary.To handle these problems, subnets were introduced to flexibly assign blocks ofaddresses within an organization. Later,CIDR was added to reduce the size of theglobal routing table.Today,the bits that indicate whether an IP address belongs toclass A, B, or C network are no longer used, though references to these classes inthe literature are still common.To see howdropping the classes made forwarding more complicated, considerhowsimple it was in the old classful system.When a packet arrivedatarouter,acopyofthe IP address was shifted right 28 bits to yield a 4-bit class number.A16-way branch then sorted packets into A, B, C (and D and E) classes, with eightof the cases for class A, four of the cases for class B, and twoofthe cases for classC. Thecode for each class then masked offthe 8-, 16-, or 24-bit network numberand right aligned it in a 32-bit word. Thenetwork number was then looked up inthe A, B, or C table, usually by indexing for A and B networks and hashing for Cnetworks. Oncethe entry was found, the outgoing line could be looked up and thepacket forwarded. Thisis much simpler than the longest matching prefix opera-tion, which can no longer use a simple table lookup because an IP address mayhave any length prefix.Class D addresses continue to be used in the Internet for multicast. Actually,itmight be more accurate to say that theyare starting to be used for multicast, sinceInternet multicast has not been widely deployed in the past.There are also several other addresses that have special meanings, as shown inFig. 5-55.The IP address 0.0.0.0, the lowest address, is used by hosts when theyare being booted.It means ‘‘this network’’or‘‘this host.’’ IPaddresses with 0 asthe network number refer to the current network. Theseaddresses allowmachinesto refer to their own network without knowing its number (but theyhaveto knowthe network mask to knowhow many0stoinclude). Theaddress consisting of all1s, or 255.255.255.255—the highest address—is used to mean all hosts on the in-dicated network. Itallows broadcasting on the local network, typically a LAN.The addresses with a proper network number and all 1s in the host field allowma-chines to send broadcast packets to distant LANs anywhere in the Internet.How-ever, manynetwork administrators disable this feature as it is mostly a securityhazard. Finally,all addresses of the form 127.xx.yy.zzare reserved for loopbacktesting. Packets sent to that address are not put out onto the wire; theyare proc-essed locally and treated as incoming packets. Thisallows packets to be sent to thehost without the sender knowing its number,which is useful for testing.NAT—Network Address TranslationIP addresses are scarce.An ISP might have a /16 address, giving it 65,534usable host numbers.If it has more customers than that, it has a problem.In fact,with 32-bit addresses, there are only 232of them and theyare all gone.'),\n",

ManyPCs in busi-nesses are expected to be on continuously.Some are employee machines, backedup at night, and some are servers that may have toservearemote request at amoment’snotice. Thesebusinesses have anaccess line that always provides con-nectivity to the rest of the Internet.Increasingly,this situation also applies to home users subscribing to ADSL orInternet overcable, since there is no hourly connection charge (as there once was),just a monthly flat rate charge). Manyofthese users have two ormore computersat home, often one for each family member,and theyall want to be online all thetime. Thesolution is to connect all the computers into a home network via a LANand put a (wireless) router on it. The router then connects to the ISP.From theISP’spoint of view, the family is nowthe same as a small business with a handfulof computers.Welcome to Jones, Inc.With the techniques we have seen so far,each computer must have its own IP address all day long.ForanISP with manythousands of customers, particularly business customers and families that are justlikesmall businesses, the demand for IP addresses can quickly exceed the blockthat is available.The problem of running out of IP addresses is not a theoretical one that mightoccur at some point in the distant future.It is happening right here and right now.The long-term solution is for the whole Internet to migrate to IPv6, which has128-bit addresses.This transition is slowly occurring, but it will be years beforethe process is complete.To get by in the meantime, a quick fix was needed.Thequick fix that is widely used today came in the form ofNAT(Network Address'),\n",

For additional information, see Dutcher (2001).The basic idea behind NAT isfor the ISP to assign each home or business asingle IP address (or at most, a small number of them) for Internet traffic.Withinthe customer network, every computer gets a unique IP address, which is used forrouting intramural traffic. However, just before a packet exits the customer net-work and goes to the ISP,anaddress translation from the unique internal IP ad-dress to the shared public IP address takes place.This translation makes use ofthree ranges of IP addresses that have been declared as private. Networks may usethem internally as theywish. Theonly rule is that no packets containing these ad-dresses may appear on the Internet itself.The three reserved ranges are:10.0.0.0 –10.255.255.255/8 (16,777,216hosts)172.16.0.0 –172.31.255.255/12 (1,048,576hosts)192.168.0.0 –192.168.255.255/16 (65,536hosts)The first range provides for 16,777,216 addresses (except for all 0s and all 1s, asusual) and is the usual choice, evenifthe network is not large.The operation of NAT isshown in Fig.5-56. Within the customer premises,every machine has a unique address of the form 10.x.y.z.However, before a packetleavesthe customer premises, it passes through aNATboxthat converts the inter-nal IP source address, 10.0.0.1 in the figure, to the customer’strue IP address,198.60.42.12 in this example. TheNATbox is often combined in a single devicewith a firewall, which provides security by carefully controlling what goes into thecustomer network and what comes out of it.We will study firewalls in Chap. 8.Itis also possible to integrate the NAT box into a router or ADSL modem.Packet aftertranslation\\nBoundary of customer premisesNAT box/firewallISProuterIP = 198.60.42.12port = 3344IP = 10.0.0.1port = 5544 (to Internet)\\nPacket beforetranslation\\nCustomerrouterand LANFigure5-56.Placement and operation of a NAT box.So far,wehaveglossed overone tinybut crucial detail: when the reply comesback (e.g., from a Web server), it is naturally addressed to 198.60.42.12, so howdoes the NAT box knowwhich internal address to replace it with?Herein lies theproblem with NAT .If there were a spare field in the IP header,that field could beused to keep track of who the real sender was, but only 1 bit is still unused.In'),\n",

Thisis not a promising alternative for a quick fix.What actually happens is as follows. TheNATdesigners observed that mostIP packets carry either TCP or UDP payloads.When we study TCP and UDP inChap. 6, we will see that both of these have headers containing a source port and adestination port.Belowwewill just discuss TCP ports, but exactly the same storyholds for UDP ports.The ports are 16-bit integers that indicate where the TCPconnection begins and ends.These ports provide the field needed to makeNATwork.When a process wants to establish a TCP connection with a remote process, itattaches itself to an unused TCP port on its own machine.This is called thesourceportand tells the TCP code where to send incoming packets belonging to this con-nection. Theprocess also supplies adestination portto tell who to give the pack-ets to on the remote side.Ports 0–1023 are reserved for well-known services.Forexample, port 80 is the port used by Web servers, so remote clients can locatethem. Eachoutgoing TCP message contains both a source port and a destinationport. Together,these ports servetoidentify the processes using the connection onboth ends.An analogy may makethe use of ports clearer.Imagine a companywith a sin-gle main telephone number.When people call the main number,theyreach an op-erator who asks which extension theywant and then puts them through to that ex-tension. Themain number is analogous to the customer’sIPaddress and the exten-sions on both ends are analogous to the ports.Ports are effectively an extra 16 bitsof addressing that identify which process gets which incoming packet.Using theSource portfield, we can solveour mapping problem.Wheneveranoutgoing packet enters the NAT box, the 10.x.y.zsource address is replaced by thecustomer’strue IP address.In addition, the TCPSource portfield is replaced byan indexinto the NAT box’s65,536-entry translation table.This table entry con-tains the original IP address and the original source port.Finally,both the IP andTCP header checksums are recomputed and inserted into the packet. Itis neces-sary to replace theSource portbecause connections from machines 10.0.0.1 and10.0.0.2 may both happen to use port 5000, for example, so theSource portaloneis not enough to identify the sending process.When an incoming packet arrivesatthe NAT box from the ISP,theDestinationportin the TCP header is extracted and used as an indexinto the NAT box’smap-ping table.From the entry located, the internal IP address and original TCP portare extracted and inserted into the packet. Thenboth the IP and TCP checksumsare recomputed and inserted into the packet. Thepacket is then passed to the cus-tomer router for normal delivery using the 10.x.y.zaddress.Although this scheme sort of solves the problem, networking purists in the IPcommunity have a tendencytoregard it as an abomination-on-the-face-of-the-earth. Brieflysummarized, here are some of the objections.First, NAT violates'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 483}, page_content='460 THE NETWORK LAYER CHAP.5the architectural model of IP,which states that every IP address uniquely identifiesasingle machine worldwide. Thewhole software structure of the Internet is builton this fact. With NAT ,thousands of machines may (and do) use address 10.0.0.1.Second, NAT breaks the end-to-end connectivity model of the Internet, whichsays that anyhost can send a packet to anyother host at anytime. Sincethe map-ping in the NAT box is set up by outgoing packets, incoming packets cannot be ac-cepted until after an outgoing one is sent.In practice, this means that a home userwith NAT can makeTCP/IP connections to a remote Web server,but a remote usercannot makeconnections to a game server on the home network. Specialconfigu-ration orNATtraversaltechniques are needed to support this situation.Third, NAT changes the Internet from a connectionless network to a verystrange kind of connection-oriented network. Theproblem is that the NAT boxmust maintain state (i.e., the mapping) for each connection passing through it.Having the network maintain connection state is a property of connection-orientednetworks, not a connectionless one.If the NAT box crashes and its mapping tableis lost, all its TCP connections are destroyed. Inthe absence of NAT ,arouter cancrash and restart with no long-term effect on TCP connections.The sending proc-ess just times out within a fewseconds and retransmits all unacknowledged pack-ets. With NAT ,the Internet becomes as vulnerable as a circuit-switched network.Fourth, NAT violates the most fundamental rule of protocol layering: layerkmay not makeany assumptions about what layerk+ 1has put into the payloadfield. Thisbasic principle is there to keep the layers independent.If TCP is laterupgraded to TCP-2, with a different header layout (e.g., 32-bit ports), NAT willfail. Thewhole idea of layered protocols is to ensure that changes in one layer donot require changes in other layers.NATdestroys this independence.Fifth, processes on the Internet are not required to use TCP or UDP.Ifauseron machineAdecides to use some newtransport protocol to talk to a user on ma-chineB(e.g., for a multimedia application), introduction of a NAT box will causethe application to fail because the NAT box will not be able to locate the TCPSource portcorrectly.Asixth and related problem is that some applications use multiple TCP/IP con-nections or UDP ports in prescribed ways. For example,FTP,the standardFileTransfer Protocol,inserts IP addresses in the body of packet for the receivertoextract and use.Since NAT knows nothing about these arrangements, it cannot re-write the IP addresses or otherwise account for them.This lack of understandingmeans that FTP and other applications such as the H.323 Internet telephonyproto-col (which we will study in Chap. 7) will fail in the presence of NAT unless specialprecautions are taken. Itis often possible to patch NAT for these cases, but havingto patch the code in the NAT box for every newapplication is not a good idea.Finally,since the TCPSource portfield is 16 bits, at most 65,536 machinescan be mapped onto an IP address.Actually,the number is slightly less becausethe first 4096 ports are reserved for special uses.However, ifmultiple IP addressesare available, each one can handle up to 61,440 machines.'),\n",

Ithas become wrapped up with firewalls and privacy because it blocks unsolicited in-coming packets by default. For this reason, it is unlikely to go awayevenwhenIPv6 is widely deployed.5.7.3 IPVersion 6IP has been in heavy use for decades.It has worked extremely well, as demon-strated by the exponential growth of the Internet.Unfortunately,IPhas become avictim of its own popularity: it is close to running out of addresses.Even withCIDR and NAT using addresses more sparingly,the last IPv4 addresses were allo-cated on Nov. 25, 2019.This looming disaster was recognized almost twodecadesago, and it sparked a great deal of discussion and controversy within the Internetcommunity about what to do about it.In this section, we will describe both the problem and several proposed solu-tions. Theonly long-term solution is to move tolarger addresses.IPv6(IP ver-sion 6)isareplacement design that does just that. It uses 128-bit addresses; ashortage of these addresses is not likely anytime in the foreseeable future.How-ever, IPv6 has provedvery difficult to deploy. Itisadifferent network layer proto-col that does not really interwork with IPv4, despite manysimilarities. Also, com-panies and users are not really sure whytheyshould want IPv6 in anycase. The re-sult is that IPv6 is deployed and used in only a fraction of the Internet (estimatesare 25%) despite having been an Internet Standard since 1998.The next severalyears will be an interesting time.Each IPv4 address is nowworth as much as $19.In 2019, a man was convicted of stockpiling 750,000 IP addresses (worth about$14 million) and selling them on the black market.In addition to the address problems, other issues loom in the background.Inits early years, the Internet was largely used by universities, high-tech industries,and the U.S. Government (especially the Dept. of Defense).With the explosion ofinterest in the Internet starting in the mid-1990s, it begantobeused by a differentgroup of people, often with different requirements.Forone thing, numerous peo-ple with smart phones use it to keep in contact with their home bases.Foranother,with the impending convergence of the computer,communication, and entertain-ment industries, it may not be that long before every telephone and television set inthe world is an Internet node, resulting in a billion machines being used for audioand video on demand.Under these circumstances, it became apparent that IP hadto evolveand become more flexible.Seeing these problems on the horizon, in 1990 IETF started work on a newversion of IP,one that would neverrun out of addresses, would solveavariety ofother problems, and be more flexible and efficient as well.Its major goals were:'),\n",

Permitthe old and newprotocols to coexist for years.The design of IPv6 presented a major opportunity to improve all of the featuresin IPv4 that fall short of what is nowwanted. Todevelop a protocol that met allthese requirements, IETF issued a call for proposals and discussion in RFC 1550.Twenty-one responses were initially received. ByDecember 1992, sevenseriousproposals were on the table.Theyranged from making minor patches to IP,tothrowing it out altogether and replacing it with a completely different protocol.One proposal was to run TCP overCLNP,the network layer protocol designedfor OSI. With its 160-bit addresses, CLNP would have provided enough addressspace foreverasitcould give every molecule of water in the oceans enough ad-dresses (roughly 25)toset up a small network. Thischoice would also have uni-fied twomajor network layer protocols.However, manypeople felt that this wouldhave been an admission that something in the OSI world was actually done right, astatement considered Politically Incorrect in Internet circles.CLNP was patternedclosely on IP,sothe twoare not really that different. Infact, the protocol ulti-mately chosen differs from IP far more than CLNP does.Another strikeagainstCLNP was its poor support for service types, something required to transmit multi-media efficiently.Three of the better proposals were published inIEEE Network(Deering, 1993;Francis, 1993; and Katz and Ford, 1993).After much discussion, revision, andjockeying for position, a modified combined version of the Deering and Francisproposals, by nowcalledSIPP(Simple Internet Protocol Plus)was selected andgiventhe designationIPv6(Internet Protocol version 6).IPv6 meets IETF’sgoals fairly well.It maintains the good features of IP,dis-cards or deemphasizes the bad ones, and adds newones where needed.In general,IPv6 is not compatible with IPv4, but it is compatible with the other auxiliary In-ternet protocols, including TCP,UDP,ICMP,IGMP,OSPF,BGP,and DNS, withsmall modifications being required to deal with longer addresses.The main fea-tures of IPv6 are discussed below. More information about it can be found in RFC2460 through RFC 2466.'),\n",

These were later retrofitted to IPv4,however, sointhe area of security the differences are not so great anymore.Finally,more attention has been paid to quality of service.Various half-hearted efforts to improve QoS have been made in the past, but now, with thegrowth of multimedia on the Internet, the sense of urgencyisgreater.The Main IPv6 HeaderThe IPv6 header is shown in Fig.5-57. TheVersionfield is always 6 for IPv6(and 4 for IPv4).During the transition period from IPv4, which has already takenmore than a decade, routers will be able to examine this field to tell what kind ofpacket theyhave.Asanaside, making this test wastes a fewinstructions in thecritical path, giventhat the data link header usually indicates the network protocolfor demultiplexing, so some routers may skip the check.Forexample, the EthernetTypefield has different values to indicate an IPv4 or an IPv6 payload.The dis-cussions between the ‘‘Do it right’’and ‘‘Makeitfast’’camps will no doubt contin-ue to be vigorous and lengthyfor years to come.TheDifferentiated servicesfield (originally calledTraffic class)isused to dis-tinguish the class of service for packets with different real-time delivery re-quirements. It is used with the differentiated service architecture for quality of ser-vice in the same manner as the field of the same name in the IPv4 packet. Also, thelow-order 2 bits are used to signal explicit congestion indications, again in thesame way as with IPv4.TheFlow labelfield provides a way for a source and destination to markgroups of packets that have the same requirements and should be treated in the'),\n",

Theflowcan be set up in advance and givenanidentifier.When a packetwith a nonzeroFlow labelshows up, all the routers can look it up in internal tablesto see what kind of special treatment it requires.In effect, flows are an attempt tohave itboth ways: the flexibility of a datagram network and the guarantees of a vir-tual-circuit network.Each flowfor quality of service purposes is designated by the source address,destination address, and flownumber.This design means that up to 220flows maybe active atthe same time between a givenpair of IP addresses.It also means thateveniftwo flows coming from different hosts but with the same flowlabel passthrough the same router,the router will be able to tell them apart using the sourceand destination addresses.It is expected that flowlabels will be chosen randomly,rather than assigned sequentially starting at 1, so routers are expected to hash them.ThePayload lengthfield tells howmanybytes followthe 40-byte header ofFig. 5-57.The name was changed from the IPv4Total lengthfield because themeaning was changed slightly: the 40 header bytes are no longer counted as part ofthe length (as theyused to be).This change means the payload can nowbe65,535bytes instead of a mere 65,515 bytes.TheNext headerfield lets the cat out of the bag.The reason the header couldbe simplified is that there can be additional (optional) extension headers.Thisfield tells which of the (currently) six extension headers, if any, followthis one.If'),\n",

Itis, in prac-tice, the same as theTime to livefield in IPv4, namely,afield that is decrementedon each hop.In theory,inIPv4 it was a time in seconds, but no router used it thatway, sothe name was changed to reflect the way it is actually used.Next come theSource addressandDestination addressfields. Deering’sorigi-nal proposal, SIP,used 8-byte addresses, but during the reviewprocess manypeo-ple felt that with 8-byte addresses IPv6 would run out of addresses within a fewdecades, whereas with 16-byte addresses it would neverrun out.Other peopleargued that 16 bytes was overkill, whereas still others favored using 20-byte ad-dresses to be compatible with the OSI datagram protocol.Still another factionwanted variable-sized addresses.After much debate and more than a fewwordsunprintable in an academic textbook, it was decided that fixed-length 16-byte ad-dresses were the best compromise.Anew notation has been devised for writing 16-byte addresses.Theyare writ-ten as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits with colons between the groups, likethis:8000:0000:0000:0000:0123:4567:89AB:CDEFSince manyaddresses will have manyzeros inside them, three optimizations havebeen authorized.First, leading zeros within a group can be omitted, so 0123 canbe written as 123.Second, one or more groups of 16 zero bits can be replaced by apair of colons.Thus, the above address nowbecomes8000::123:4567:89AB:CDEFFinally,IPv4 addresses can be written as a pair of colons and an old dotted decimalnumber,for example:::192.31.20.46Perhaps it is unnecessary to be so explicit about it, but there are a lot of16-byte addresses.Specifically,there are 2128of them, which is approximately3× 1038.Ifthe entire earth, land and water,were covered with computers, IPv6would allow7× 1023IP addresses per square meter.Students of chemistry willnotice that this number is larger than Avogadro’snumber.While it was not theintention to give every molecule on the surface of the earth its own IP address, weare not that far off.In practice, the address space will not be used efficiently,just as the telephonenumber address space is not (the area code for Manhattan, 212, is nearly full, butthat for Wyoming, 307, is nearly empty).In RFC 3194, Durand and Huitema cal-culated that, using the allocation of telephone numbers as a guide, eveninthe mostpessimistic scenario there will still be well over1000 IP addresses per square meterof the entire earth’ssurface (land and water). Inanylikely scenario, there will be'),\n",

In brief, when a hostsends an IPv6 packet that is too large, instead of fragmenting it, the router that isunable to forward it drops the packet and sends an error message back to the send-ing host.This message tells the host to break up all future packets to that destina-tion. Having the host send packets that are the right size in the first place is ulti-mately much more efficient than having the routers fragment them on the fly.Also, the minimum-size packet that routers must be able to forward has been raisedfrom 576 to 1280 bytes to allow1024 bytes of data and manyheaders.Finally,theChecksumfield is gone because calculating it greatly reduces per-formance. With the reliable networks nowused, combined with the fact that thedata link layer and transport layers normally have their own checksums, the valueof yet another checksum was deemed not worth the performance price it extracted.Removing all these features has resulted in a lean and mean network layer proto-col. Thus,the goal of IPv6—a fast, yet flexible, protocol with plenty of addressspace—is met by this design.Extension HeadersSome of the missing IPv4 fields are occasionally still needed, so IPv6 intro-duces the concept of (optional)extension headers.These headers can be suppliedto provide extra information, but encoded in an efficient way.Six kinds of exten-sion headers are defined at present, as listed in Fig.5-58. Eachone is optional, butif more than one is present theymust appear directly after the fixed header,andpreferably in the order listed.Some of the headers have a fixed format; others contain a variable number ofvariable-length options.Forthese, each item is encoded as a (Type,Length, Value)tuple. TheTypeis a 1-byte field telling which option this is.TheTypevalues havebeen chosen so that the first 2 bits tell routers that do not knowhow toprocess theoption what to do.The choices are: skip the option; discard the packet; discard thepacket and send back an ICMP packet; and discard the packet but do not sendICMP packets for multicast addresses (to prevent one bad multicast packet fromgenerating millions of ICMP reports).TheLengthis also a 1-byte field. Ittells howlong the value is (0 to 255bytes). TheValueis anyinformation required, up to 255 bytes.'),\n",

Thisbyte is followed by one telling howlong the hop-by-hopheader is in bytes, excluding the first 8 bytes, which are mandatory.All extensionsbegin this way.The next 2 bytes indicate that this option defines the datagram size (code 194)and that the size is a 4-byte number.The last 4 bytes give the size of the datagram.Sizes less than 65,536 bytes are not permitted and will result in the first router dis-carding the packet and sending back an ICMP error message.Datagrams usingthis header extension are calledjumbograms.The use of jumbograms is impor-tant for supercomputer applications that must transfer gigabytes of data efficientlyacross the Internet.The destination options header is intended for fields that need only be inter-preted at the destination host.In the initial version of IPv6, the only options de-fined are null options for padding this header out to a multiple of 8 bytes, so ini-tially it will not be used.It was included to makesure that newrouting and hostsoftware can handle it, in case someone thinks of a destination option some day.The routing header lists one or more routers that must be visited on the way tothe destination.It is very similar to the IPv4 loose source routing in that all ad-dresses listed must be visited in order,but other routers not listed may be visited inbetween.

Othertypes may be invented in the future, as needed.Finally,theSeg-ments leftfield keeps track of howmanyofthe addresses in the list have not yetbeen visited.It is decremented every time one is visited.When it hits 0, the pack-et is on its own with no more guidance about what route to follow. Usually,atthispoint it is so close to the destination that the best route is obvious.The fragment header deals with fragmentation similarly to the way IPv4 does.The header holds the datagram identifier,fragment number,and a bit telling wheth-er more fragments will follow. InIPv6, unlikeinIPv4, only the source host canfragment a packet. Routersalong the way may not do this.This change is a majorphilosophical break with the original IP,but in keeping with current practice forIPv4. Plus, it simplifies the routers’ work and makes routing go faster.Asmen-tioned above,ifarouter is confronted with a packet that is too big, it discards thepacket and sends an ICMP error packet back to the source.This information al-lows the source host to fragment the packet into smaller pieces using this headerand try again.The authentication header provides a mechanism by which the receiverofapacket can be sure of who sent it.The encrypted security payload makes it pos-sible to encrypt the contents of a packet so that only the intended recipient can readit. Theseheaders use the cryptographic techniques that we will describe in Chap. 8to accomplish their missions.ControversiesGiventhe open design process and the strongly held opinions of manyofthepeople involved, it should come as no surprise that manychoices made for IPv6were highly controversial, to say the least.We will summarize a fewofthesebriefly below. For all the gory details, see the RFCs.We havealready mentioned the argument about the address length.The resultwasacompromise: 16-byte fixed-length addresses.'),\n",

Onecamp feltstrongly that limiting the maximum number of hops to 255 (implicit in using an8-bit field) was a gross mistake. Afterall, paths of 32 hops are common now, and10 years from nowmuch longer paths may be common.These people argued thatusing a huge address size was farsighted but using a tinyhop count was short-sighted. Intheir view, the greatest sin a computer scientist can commit is to pro-vide too fewbits somewhere.The response was that arguments could be made to increase every field, lead-ing to a bloated header.Also, the function of theHop limitfield is to keep packetsfrom wandering around for too long a time and 65,535 hops is far,far too long.Finally,asthe Internet grows, more and more long-distance links will be built,making it possible to get from anycountry to anyother country in half a dozenhops at most.If it takes more than 125 hops to get from the source and the destina-tion to their respective international gateways, something is wrong with the nation-al backbones.The 8-bitters won this one.Another hot potato was the maximum packet size.The supercomputer com-munity wanted packets in excess of 64 KB.When a supercomputer gets startedtransferring, it really means business and does not want to be interrupted every64 KB.The argument against large packets is that if a 1-MB packet hits a1.5-Mbps T1 line, that packet will tie the line up for over5seconds, producing avery noticeable delay for interactive users sharing the line.Acompromise wasreached here: normal packets are limited to 64 KB, but the hop-by-hop extensionheader can be used to permit jumbograms.Athird hot topic was removing the IPv4 checksum.Some people likened thismove toremoving the brakes from a car.Doing so makes the car lighter so it cango faster,but if an unexpected event happens, you have a problem.The argument against checksums was that anyapplication that really caresabout data integrity has to have a transport layer checksum anyway,sohaving an-other one in IP (in addition to the data link layer checksum) is overkill. Fur-thermore, experience showed that computing the IP checksum was a major expensein IPv4.The antichecksum camp won this one, and IPv6 does not have a check-sum.Mobile hosts were also a point of contention.If a portable computer flies half-wayaround the world, can it continue operating there with the same IPv6 address,or does it have touse a scheme with home agents?Some people wanted to buildexplicit support for mobile hosts into IPv6.That effort failed when no consensuscould be found for anyspecific proposal.Probably the biggest battle was about security.Everyone agreed it was essen-tial. Thewarwas about where to put it.The argument for putting it in the networklayer is that it then becomes a standard service that all applications can use withoutanyadvance planning.The argument against it is that really secure applicationsgenerally want nothing less than end-to-end encryption, where the source applica-tion does the encryption and the destination application undoes it.With anything'),\n",

Asaresult, anyIPimplementation that used a cryptographic system strongenough to be of much value could not be exported from the United States (andmanyother countries) to customers worldwide. Having to maintain twosets ofsoftware, one for domestic use and one for export, is something most computervendors vigorously oppose.One point on which there was no controversy is that no one expects the IPv4Internet to be turned offonaSunday evening and come back up as an IPv6 InternetMonday morning.Instead, isolated ‘‘islands’’ofIPv6 will be converted, initiallycommunicating via tunnels, as we showed in Sec.5.5.4. Asthe IPv6 islands grow,theywill merge into bigger islands.Eventually,all the islands will merge, and theInternet will be fully converted.At least, that was the plan.Deployment has provedthe Achilles heel of IPv6.It’suse is still far from universal, though all major operating systems fully supportit and have supported it for overadecade. Most deployments are newsituations inwhich a network operator—for example, a mobile phone operator— needs a largenumber of IP addresses.Nevertheless, it is slowly taking over. OnComcast, mosttrafficisnow IPv6 and a quarter of Google’sisalso IPv6, so there is progress.Manystrategies have been defined to help ease the transition. Among them areways to automatically configure the tunnels that carry IPv6 overthe IPv4 Internet,and ways for hosts to automatically find the tunnel endpoints.Dual-stack hostshave anIPv4 and an IPv6 implementation so that theycan select which protocol touse depending on the destination of the packet. These strategies will streamline thesubstantial deployment that seems inevitable when IPv4 addresses are exhausted.Formore information about IPv6, see Davies (2008).5.7.4 Internet Control ProtocolsIn addition to IP,which is used for data transfer,the Internet has several com-panion control protocols that are used in the network layer.Theyinclude ICMP,ARP,and DHCP.Inthis section, we will look at each of these in turn, describingthe versions that correspond to IPv4 because theyare the protocols that are in com-mon use.

ICMPis alsoused to test the Internet.About a dozen types of ICMP messages are defined.Each ICMP message type is carried encapsulated in an IP packet.

It finds this information without anykind ofprivileged network support. The method is simply to send a sequence of packets tothe destination, first with a TtL of 1, then a TtL of 2, 3, and so on. The counters onthese packets will reach zero at successive routers along the path.These routerswill each obediently send aTIME EXCEEDEDmessage back to the host. Fromthose messages, the host can determine the IP addresses of the routers along thepath, as well as keep statistics and timings on parts of the path.It is not what theTIME EXCEEDEDmessage was intended for,but it is perhaps the most useful net-work debugging tool of all time.ThePARAMETER PROBLEMmessage indicates that an illegalvalue has beendetected in a header field.

However, itstill needs some way to find the destination’sEther-net address to send the frame.One solution is to have a configuration file some-where in the system that maps IP addresses onto Ethernet addresses.While thissolution is certainly possible, for organizations with thousands of machines keep-ing all these files up to date is an error-prone, time-consuming job.Abetter solution is for host 1 to output a broadcast packet onto the Ethernetasking who owns IP address 192.32.65.5.The broadcast will arrive atevery ma-chine on the CS Ethernet, and each one will check its IP address.Host 2 alone willrespond with its Ethernet address (E2). Inthis way host 1 learns that IP address192.32.65.5 is on the host with Ethernet addressE2.The protocol used for askingthis question and getting the reply is calledARP(Address Resolution Protocol).Almost every machine on the Internet runs it.ARP is defined in RFC 826.The advantage of using ARP overconfiguration files is the simplicity.Thesystem manager does not have todomuch except assign each machine an IP ad-dress and decide about subnet masks.ARP does the rest.At this point, the IP software on host 1 builds an Ethernet frame addressed toE2,puts the IP packet (addressed to 192.32.65.5) in the payload field, and dumps it'),\n",

ThisARP broadcast can be avoided by having host 1 include itsIP-to-Ethernet mapping in the ARP packet. Whenthe ARP broadcast arrivesathost 2, the pair (192.32.65.7,E1)isentered into host 2’sARP cache.In fact, allmachines on the Ethernet can enter this mapping into their ARP caches.To allowmappings to change, for example, when a host is configured to use anewIPaddress (but keeps its old Ethernet address), entries in the ARP cacheshould time out after a fewminutes. Acleverway to help keep the cached infor-mation current and to optimize performance is to have every machine broadcast itsmapping when it is configured. Thisbroadcast is generally done in the form of anARP looking for its own IP address.There should not be a response, but a side ef-fect of the broadcast is to makeorupdate an entry in everyone’sARP cache.Thisis known as agratuitous ARP.Ifaresponse does (unexpectedly) arrive,two ma-chines have been assigned the same IP address.The error must be resolved by thenetwork manager before both machines can use the network.Nowlet us look at Fig.5-62 again, only this time assume that host 1 wants tosend a packet to host 4 (192.32.63.8) on the EE network. Host1will see that thedestination IP address is not on the CS network. It knows to send all such off-net-work traffictothe router,which is also known as thedefault gateway.Byconven-tion, the default gatewayisthe lowest address on the network (198.32.65.1). Tosend a frame to the router,host 1 must still knowthe Ethernet address of the routerinterface on the CS network. It discovers this by sending an ARP broadcast for198.32.65.1, from which it learnsE3.Itthen sends the frame.The same lookupmechanisms are used to send a packet from one router to the next overasequenceof routers in an Internet path.When the Ethernet NIC of the router gets this frame, it givesthe packet to theIP software. It knows from the network masks that the packet should be sent ontothe EE network where it will reach host 4. If the router does not knowthe Ethernetaddress for host 4, then it will use ARP again to find out.The table in Fig.5-62lists the source and destination Ethernet and IP addresses that are present in theframes as observed on the CS and EE networks. Please observethat the Ethernetaddresses change with the frame on each network while the IP addresses remainconstant (because theyindicate the endpoints across all of the interconnected net-works).'),\n",

The solution is to have the router answerARPs on the CS network for host 4 and give its Ethernet address,E3,asthe re-sponse. Itis not possible to have host 4 reply directly because it will not see theARP request (as routers do not forward Ethernet-levelbroadcasts). The router willthen receive frames sent to 192.32.63.8 and forward them onto the EE network.This solution is calledproxy ARP.Itisused in special cases in which a hostwants to appear on a network eventhough it actually resides on another network.Acommon situation, for example, is a mobile computer that wants some othernode to pick up packets for it when it is not on its home network.DHCP—The Dynamic Host Configuration ProtocolARP (as well as other Internet protocols) makes the assumption that hosts areconfigured with some basic information, such as their own IP addresses. Howdohosts get this information?It is possible to manually configure each computer,butthat is tedious and error-prone. Thereis a better way,and it is calledDHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).With DHCP,every network must have a DHCP server that is responsible forconfiguration. Whenacomputer is started, it has a built-in Ethernet or other linklayer address embedded in the NIC, but no IP address.Much likeARP,the com-puter broadcasts a request for an IP address on its network. It does this by using aDHCP DISCOVERpacket. Thispacket must reach the DHCP server.Ifthat serveris not directly attached to the network, the router will be configured to receiveDHCP broadcasts and relay them to the DHCP server,whereveritislocated.When the server receivesthe request, it allocates a free IP address and sends itto the host in aDHCP OFFERpacket (which again may be relayed via the router).To beable to do this work evenwhen hosts do not have IPaddresses, the serveridentifies a host using its Ethernet address (which is carried in theDHCP DIS-COVERpacket)An issue that arises with automatic assignment of IP addresses from a pool isfor howlong an IP address should be allocated.If a host leavesthe network anddoes not return its IP address to the DHCP server,that address will be permanentlylost. Afteraperiod of time, manyaddresses may be lost.To prevent that fromhappening, IP address assignment may be for a fixed period of time, a techniquecalledleasing.Just before the lease expires, the host must ask for a DHCPrenewal. Ifit fails to makearequest or the request is denied, the host may no long-er use the IP address it was givenearlier.DHCP is described in RFC 2131 and RFC 2132.It is widely used in the Inter-net to configure all sorts of parameters in addition to providing hosts with IP ad-dresses. Aswell as in business and home networks, DHCP is used by ISPs to setthe parameters of devices overthe Internet access link, so that customers do notneed to phone their ISPs to get this information.Common examples of the kind of'),\n",

DHCPhas largelyreplaced earlier protocols (called RARP and BOOTP) with more limited func-tionality.5.7.5 LabelSwitching and MPLSSo far,onour tour of the network layer of the Internet, we have focused exclu-sively on packets as datagrams that are forwarded by IP routers. There is also an-other kind of technology that is starting to be widely used, especially by ISPs, inorder to move Internet trafficacross their networks. Thistechnology is calledMPLS(MultiProtocol Label Switching)and it is perilously close to circuitswitching. Despitethe fact that manypeople in the Internet community have anintense dislikefor connection-oriented networking, the idea seems to keep comingback. AsYogi Berra once put it, it is likedéjà vu all overagain. However, thereare essential differences between the way the Internet handles route constructionand the way connection-oriented networks do it, so the technique is certainly nottraditional circuit switching.MPLS adds a label in front of each packet, and forwarding is based on thelabel rather than on the destination address.Making the label an indexinto an in-ternal table makes finding the correct output line just a matter of table lookup.Using this technique, forwarding can be done very quickly.This advantage wasthe original motivation behind MPLS, which beganasproprietary technologyknown by various names includingtag switching.Eventually,IETF begantostan-dardize the idea.It is described in RFC 3031 and manyother RFCs.The mainbenefits overtime have come to be routing that is flexible and forwarding that issuited to quality of service as well as fast.The first question to ask is where does the label go?Since IP packets were notdesigned for virtual circuits, there is no field available for virtual-circuit numberswithin the IP header.For this reason, a newMPLS header had to be added in frontof the IP header.Onarouter-to-router line using PPP as the framing protocol, theframe format, including the PPP,MPLS, IP,and TCP headers, is as shown inFig. 5-63.The generic MPLS header is 4 bytes long and has four fields. Most importantis theLabelfield, which holds the index. TheQoSfield indicates the class of ser-vice. TheSfield relates to stacking multiple labels (which is discussed below).TheTtLfield indicates howmanymore times the packet may be forwarded. It isdecremented at each router,and if it hits 0, the packet is discarded.This featureprevents infinite looping in the case of routing instability.MPLS falls between the IP network layer protocol and the PPP link layer pro-tocol. It is not really a layer 3 protocol because it depends on IP or other networklayer addresses to set up label paths. It is not really a layer 2 protocol either be-cause it forwards packets across multiple hops, not a single link.Forthis reason,'),\n",

MPLS can also carry IP packets overnon-IP networks.When an MPLS-enhanced packet arrivesataLSR(Label Switched Router),the label is used as an indexinto a table to determine the outgoing line to use andalso the newlabel to use.This label swapping is used in all virtual-circuit net-works. Labelshave only local significance and twodifferent routers can feed unre-lated packets with the same label into another router for transmission on the sameoutgoing line.To bedistinguishable at the other end, labels have toberemapped atevery hop.We saw this mechanism in action in Fig.5-3. MPLSuses the sametechnique.As an aside, some people distinguish betweenforwardingandswitching.For-warding is the process of finding the best match for a destination address in a tableto decide where to send packets. Anexample is the longest matching prefix algo-rithm used for IP forwarding. Incontrast, switching uses a label taken from thepacket as an indexinto a forwarding table. It is simpler and faster.These defini-tions are far from universal, however.Since most hosts and routers do not understand MPLS, we should also askwhen and howthe labels are attached to packets. Thishappens when an IP packetreaches the edge of an MPLS network. TheLER(Label Edge Router)inspectsthe destination IP address and other fields to see which MPLS path the packetshould follow, and puts the right label on the front of the packet. Within the MPLSnetwork, this label is used to forward the packet. At the other edge of the MPLSnetwork, the label has served its purpose and is removed, revealing the IP packetagain for the next network. This process is shown in Fig.5-64. Onedifferencefrom traditional virtual circuits is the levelofaggregation. Itis certainly possible'),\n",

However, itis more common for routers to group multiple flows that end at a particular routeror LAN and use a single label for them.The flows that are grouped together underasingle label are said to belong to the sameFEC(Forwarding EquivalenceClass). Thisclass covers not only where the packets are going, but also their ser-vice class (in the differentiated services sense) because all the packets are treatedthe same way for forwarding purposes.With traditional virtual-circuit routing, it is not possible to group several dis-tinct paths with different endpoints onto the same virtual-circuit identifier becausethere would be no way to distinguish them at the final destination.With MPLS,the packets still contain their final destination address, in addition to the label. Atthe end of the labeled route, the label header can be removedand forwarding cancontinue the usual way,using the network layer destination address.Actually,MPLS goes evenfurther.Itcan operate at multiple levels at once byadding more than one label to the front of a packet. For example, suppose thatthere are manypackets that already have different labels (because we want to treatthe packets differently somewhere in the network) that should followacommonpath to some destination.Instead of setting up manylabel switching paths, one foreach of the different labels, we can set up a single path. When the already-labeledpackets reach the start of this path, another label is added to the front.This is call-ed a stack of labels.The outermost label guides the packets along the path. It is re-movedatthe end of the path, and the labels revealed, if any, are used to forwardthe packet further.TheSbit in Fig.5-63 allows a router removing a label to knowif there are anyadditional labels left.It is set to 1 for the bottom label and 0 for allthe other labels.The final question we will ask is howthe label forwarding tables are set up sothat packets followthem. Thisis one area of major difference between MPLS andconventional virtual-circuit designs.In traditional virtual-circuit networks, when auser wants to establish a connection, a setup packet is launched into the network tocreate the path and makethe forwarding table entries.MPLS does not involveusers in the setup phase. Requiring users to do anything other than send a datagramwould break too much existing Internet software.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 502}, page_content='SEC. 5.7 THE NETWORK LAYER IN THE INTERNET 479Instead, the forwarding information is set up by protocols that are a combina-tion of routing protocols and connection setup protocols. These control protocolsare separated from label forwarding, which allows multiple, different control proto-cols to be used.One of the variants works likethis. Whenarouter is booted, itchecks to see which routes it is the final destination for (e.g., which prefixes belongto its interfaces). Itthen creates one or more FECs for them, allocates a label foreach one, and passes the labels to its neighbors.They, inturn, enter the labels intheir forwarding tables and send newlabels to their neighbors, until all the routershave acquired the path.Resources can also be reserved as the path is constructedto guarantee an appropriate quality of service.Other variants can set up differentpaths, such as trafficengineering paths that takeunused capacity into account, andcreate paths on-demand to support service offerings such as quality of service.Although the basic ideas behind MPLS are straightforward, the details arecomplicated, with manyvariations and use cases that are being actively developed.Formore information, see Davie and Farrel (2008) and Davie and Rekhter (2000).5.7.6 OSPF—AnInterior Gateway Routing ProtocolWe havenowfinished our study of howpackets are forwarded in the Internet.It is time to move ontothe next topic: routing in the Internet.As we mentionedearlier,the Internet is made up of a large number of independent networks orASes(Autonomous Systems)that are operated by different organizations, usually acompany, university,orISP.Inside of its own network, an organization can use itsownalgorithm for internal routing, orintradomain routing,asitismore com-monly known. Nevertheless, there are only a handful of standard protocols that arepopular.Inthis section, we will study the problem of intradomain routing and lookat the OSPF protocol that is widely used in practice.An intradomain routing pro-tocol is also called anIGP(Interior Gateway Protocol). Inthe next section, wewill study the problem of routing between independently operated networks, orinterdomain routing.For that case, all networks must use the same interdomainrouting protocol orexterior gateway protocol.The protocol that is used in the In-ternet is BGP (Border GatewayProtocol). Itwill be discussed in Sec. 5.7.7.Early intradomain routing protocols used a distance vector design, based onthe distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm inherited from the ARPANET.RIP(Rout-ing Information Protocol)isthe main example that is used to this day.Itworkswell in small systems, but less well as networks get larger.Italso suffers from thecount-to-infinity problem and generally slowconvergence. TheARPANETswitched overtoalink state protocol in May 1979 because of these problems, andin 1988 IETF beganwork on a link state protocol for intradomain routing.Thatprotocol, calledOSPF(Open Shortest Path First), became a standard in 1990.Itdrewonaprotocol calledIS-IS(Intermediate-System to Intermediate-System),which became an ISO standard.Because of their shared heritage, the twoproto-cols are much more alikethan different.

OSPF is more widely used in companynetworks, and IS-ISis more widely used in ISP networks. Ofthe two, we will give a sketch of howOSPF works.Giventhe long experience with other routing protocols, the group designingOSPF had a long list of requirements that had to be met.First, the algorithm hadto be published in the open literature, hence the ‘‘O’’inOSPF.Aproprietary solu-tion owned by one companywould not do.Second, the newprotocol had to sup-port a variety of distance metrics, including physical distance, delay,and so on.Third, it had to be a dynamic algorithm, one that adapted to changes in the topo-logy automatically and quickly.Fourth, and newfor OSPF,ithad to support routing based on type of service.The newprotocol had to be able to route real-time trafficone way and other trafficadifferent way.Atthe time, IP had aType of servicefield, but no existing routingprotocol used it.This field was included in OSPF but still nobody used it, and itwaseventually removed. Perhaps this requirement was ahead of its time, as it pre-ceded IETF’swork on differentiated services, which has rejuvenated classes of ser-vice.Fifth, and related to the above,OSPF had to do load balancing, splitting theload overmultiple lines.Most previous protocols sent all packets overasinglebest route, evenifthere were tworoutes that were equally good.The other routewasnot used at all.In manycases, splitting the load overmultiple routes givesbetter performance.Sixth, support for hierarchical systems was needed.By 1988, some networkshad grown so large that no router could be expected to knowthe entire topology.OSPF had to be designed so that no router would have to.Seventh, some modicum of security was required to prevent fun-loving stu-dents from spoofing routers by sending them false routing information.Finally,provision was needed for dealing with routers that were connected to the Internetvia a tunnel.Previous protocols did not handle this well.OSPF supports both point-to-point links (e.g., SONET) and broadcast net-works (e.g., most LANs). Actually,itisable to support networks with multiplerouters, each of which can communicate directly with the others (calledmultiac-cess networks)eveniftheydonot have broadcast capability.Earlier protocols didnot handle this case well.An example of an autonomous system network is giveninFig. 5-65(a).Hostsare omitted because theydonot generally play a role in OSPF,while routers andnetworks (which may contain hosts) do.Most of the routers in Fig.5-65(a) areconnected to other routers by point-to-point links, and to networks to reach thehosts on those networks. However, routersR3,R4,andR5are connected by abroadcast LAN such as switched Ethernet.OSPF operates by abstracting the collection of actual networks, routers, andlinks into a directed graph in which each arc is assigned a weight (distance, delay,'),\n",

Abroadcast networkis represented by a node for the network itself, plus a node for each router.Thearcs from that network node to the routers have weight 0.Theyare importantnonetheless, as without them there is no path through the network. Other networks,which have only hosts, have only an arc reaching them and not one returning.Thisstructure givesroutes to hosts, but not through them.Figure 5-65(b) shows the graph representation of the network of Fig.5-65(a).What OSPF fundamentally does is represent the actual network as a graph likethisand then use the link state method to have every router compute the shortest pathfrom itself to all other nodes. Multiple paths may be found that are equally short.In this case, OSPF remembers the set of shortest paths and during packet for-warding, trafficissplit across them.This helps to balance load. It is calledECMP(Equal Cost MultiPath).Manyofthe ASes in the Internet are themselves large and nontrivial to man-age. Towork at this scale, OSPF allows an AS to be divided into numberedareas,where an area is a network or a set of contiguous networks. Areasdo not overlapbutneed not be exhaustive,that is, some routers may belong to no area.Routersthat lie wholly within an area are calledinternal routers.Anarea is a gener-alization of an individual network. Outsidean area, its destinations are visible butnot its topology.This characteristic helps routing to scale.Every AS has abackbone area,called area 0. The routers in this area are call-edbackbone routers.All areas are connected to the backbone, possibly by tun-nels, so it is possible to go from anyarea in the AS to anyother area in the AS via'),\n",

This summary includes cost information but not allthe details of the topology within an area. Passing cost information allows hosts inother areas to find the best area border router to use to enter an area.Not passingtopology information reduces trafficand simplifies the shortest-path computationsof routers in other areas.However, ifthere is only one border router out of an area,eventhe summary does not need to be passed. Routes to destinations out of thearea always start with the instruction ‘‘Go to the border router.’’This kind of areais called astub area.The last kind of router is theAS boundary router.Itinjects routes to externaldestinations on other ASes into the area. The external routes then appear as desti-nations that can be reached via the AS boundary router with some cost.An exter-nal route can be injected at one or more AS boundary routers.The relationship be-tween ASes, areas, and the various kinds of routers is shown in Fig.5-66.

Becausethe route with the lowest cost is chosen, routers in different partsof the network may use different area border routers to enter the backbone anddestination area.Packets are routed from source to destination ‘‘as is.’’ Theyarenot encapsulated or tunneled (unless going to an area whose only connection to thebackbone is a tunnel).Also, routes to external destinations may include the exter-nal cost from the AS boundary router overthe external path, if desired, or just thecost internal to the AS.When a router boots, it sendsHELLOmessages on all of its point-to-point linesand multicasts them on LANs to the group consisting of all the other routers.From the responses, each router learns who its neighbors are.Routers on the sameLAN are all neighbors.OSPF works by exchanging information between adjacent routers, which is notthe same as between neighboring routers.In particular,itisinefficient to haveevery router on a LAN talk to every other router on the LAN.To avoid this situa-tion, one router is elected as thedesignated router.Itissaid to beadjacentto allthe other routers on its LAN, and exchanges information with them.In effect, it isacting as the single node that represents the LAN.Neighboring routers that are notadjacent do not exchange information with each other.Abackup designated routeris always kept up to date to ease the transition should the primary designated routercrash and need to be replaced immediately.During normal operation, each router periodically floodsLINK STATEUPDATEmessages to each of its adjacent routers.These messages givesits state and pro-vide the costs used in the topological database.The flooding messages areacknowledged, to makethem reliable.Each message has a sequence number,soarouter can see whether an incomingLINK STATEUPDATEis older or newer thanwhat it currently has.Routers also send these messages when a link goes up ordown or its cost changes.DATABASE DESCRIPTIONmessages give the sequence numbers of all the linkstate entries currently held by the sender.Bycomparing its own values with thoseof the sender,the receivercan determine who has the most recent values.

Theresult of this algorithm is that each pair ofadjacent routers checks to see who has the most recent data, and newinformationis spread throughout the area this way.All these messages are sent directly in IPpackets. Thefive kinds of messages are summarized in Fig. 5-67.Finally,wecan put all the pieces together.Using flooding, each router informsall the other routers in its area of its links to other routers and networks and thecost of these links.This information allows each router to construct the graph forits area(s) and compute the shortest paths.The backbone area does this work, too.In addition, the backbone routers accept information from the area border routersin order to compute the best route from each backbone router to every other router.'),\n",

Adifferent protocol is needed because the goals of an intradomain protocoland an interdomain protocol are not the same.All an intradomain protocol has todo is move packets as efficiently as possible from the source to the destination.Itdoes not have toworry about politics.In contrast, interdomain routing protocols have toworry about politics a greatdeal (Metz, 2001).Forexample, a corporate AS might want the ability to sendpackets to anyInternet site and receive packets from anyInternet site.However, itmight be unwilling to carry transit packets originating in a foreign AS and endingin a different foreign AS, evenifits own AS is on the shortest path between thetwoforeign ASes (‘‘That’stheir problem, not ours’’). Onthe other hand, it mightbe willing to carry transit trafficfor its neighbors, or evenfor specific other ASesthat paid it for this service.Telephone companies, for example, might be happytoact as carriers for their customers, but not for others.Exterior gatewayprotocols ingeneral, and BGP in particular,havebeen designed to allowmanykinds of routingpolicies to be enforced in the interAS traffic.Typical policies involvepolitical, security,oreconomic considerations.Afewexamples of possible routing constraints are:1. Donot carry commercial trafficonthe educational network.2. Neversend trafficfrom the Pentagon on a route through Iraq.3. UseTeliaSonera instead of Verizon because it is cheaper.4. Don’tuse AT&T in Australia because performance is poor.5. Trafficstarting or ending at Apple should not transit Google.'),\n",

One common policyisthat a customer ISP pays anoth-er provider ISP to deliverpackets to anyother destination on the Internet and re-ceive packets sent from anyother destination. The customer ISP is said to buytransit servicefrom the provider ISP.This is very similar a customer at homebuying Internet access service from an ISP.Tomakeitwork, the provider shouldadvertise routes to all destinations on the Internet to the customer overthe link thatconnects them.In this way,the customer will have a route to use to send packetsanywhere. Conversely,the customer should advertise routes only to the destina-tions on its network to the provider.This will let the provider send traffictothecustomer only for those addresses; the customer does not want to handle trafficin-tended for other destinations.We can see an example of transit service in Fig.5-68. Thereare four ASes thatare connected. The connection is often made with a link atIXPs(InterneteXchange Points), facilities to which manyISPs have a link for the purpose ofconnecting with other ISPs.AS2,AS3,andAS4are customers ofAS1.Theybuytransit service from it. Thus, when sourceAsends to destinationC,the packetstravelfromAS2toAS1and finally toAS4.The routing advertisements travelintheopposite direction to the packets.AS4advertisesCas a destination to its transitprovider,AS1,tolet sources reachCviaAS1.Later,AS1advertises a route toCtoits other customers, includingAS2,tolet the customers knowthat theycan sendtraffictoCviaAS1.\\nTRAS1\\nAS2AS3AS4\\nA PE CUPECUCUTRTRPath of BGP routingadvertisements (dash)Path of IPpackets (solid)\\nRouting policy:TR = TransitCU = CustomerPE = Peer\\nB CFigure5-68.Routing policies between four autonomous systems.In Fig.5-68, all of the other ASes buy transit service fromAS1.This providesthem with connectivity so theycan interact with anyhost on the Internet.

Giventhat their networks are connected already,iftheywant to, theycanuse a different policy—theycan send trafficdirectly to each other for free. Thiswill reduce the amount of traffictheymust haveAS1deliverontheir behalf, andhopefully it will reduce their bills. This policyiscalledsettlement-free peeringorsettlement-free interconnection.To implement settlement-free peering, twoASes send routing advertisementsto each other for the addresses that reside in their networks. Doingso makes itpossible forAS2to sendAS3packets fromAdestined toBand vice versa. Howev-er,note that settlement-free peering is not transitive.InFig. 5-68,AS3andAS4alsopeer with each other.This arrangement allows trafficfromCdestined forBto besent directly toAS4.What happens ifCsends a packet toA?AS3is only advertis-ing a route toBtoAS4.Itisnot advertising a route toA.The consequence is thattrafficwill not pass fromAS4toAS3toAS2,eventhough a physical path exists.This restriction is exactly whatAS3wants. It peers withAS4to exchange traffic,butdoes not want to carry trafficfromAS4to other parts of the Internet since it isnot being paid to do so.Instead,AS4gets transit service fromAS1.Thus, it isAS1that will carry the packet fromCtoA.Nowthat we knowabout transit and settlement-free peering, we can also seethatA,B,andChave transit arrangements. For example,Amust buy Internet ac-cess fromAS2.Amight be a single home computer or a companynetwork withmanyLANs. However, itdoes not need to run BGP because it is astub networkthat is connected to the rest of the Internet by only one link.So the only place forit to send packets destined outside of the network is overthe link toAS2.There isnowhere else to go.This path can be arranged simply by setting up a default route.Forthis reason, we have not shownA,B,andCas ASes that participate in interdo-main routing.Transit and settlement-free peering business arrangements are implementedthrough a combination of routing policies that implement (1) preference amongmultiple routes to a destination, (2) filtering of howroutes are advertised to neigh-boring networks. Generallyspeaking, preference works as follows: a router willprefer routes learned from paying customers first, followed by routes learned fromsettlement-free peers, and finally routes learned from provider networks. The ratio-nale is simple: an AS would prefer to send trafficalong routes where it is paid, asopposed to sending trafficonroutes where it has to pay for use.Forsimilar rea-sons, an AS will advertise all of its routes to customers, but it will not re-advertiseroutes learned from a settlement-free peer or transit provider to other peers or pro-viders. Inaddition to these twobusiness arrangements, ASes have other arrange-ments, includingpaid peering,whereby one AS pays another for access to routeslearned from that ASes customers. Paid peering is similar to settlement-free peer-ing, except that moneychanges hands.Finally,there can also bepartial transitarrangements, whereby an AS might pay another AS for routes to some subset ofall Internet destinations.'),\n",

This technique isused to improve reliability,since if the path through one ISP fails, the companycanuse the path via the other ISP.This technique is calledmultihoming.Inthis case,the companynetwork is likely to run an interdomain routing protocol (e.g., BGP)to tell other ASes which addresses should be reached via which ISP links.Manyvariations on these transit and peering policies are possible, but theyal-ready illustrate howbusiness relationships and control overwhere route advertise-ments go can implement different kinds of policies.Nowwewill consider in moredetail howrouters running BGP advertise routes to each other and select paths overwhich to forward packets.BGP is a form of distance vector protocol, but it is quite unlikeintradomaindistance vector protocols such as RIP.Wehavealready seen that policy, instead ofminimum distance, is used to pick which routes to use.Another large difference isthat instead of maintaining just the cost of the route to each destination, each BGProuter keeps track of the path used.This approach is called apath vector proto-col.The path consists of the next hop router (which may be on the other side ofthe ISP,not adjacent) and the sequence of ASes, orAS path,that the route has fol-lowed (giveninreverse order).Finally,pairs of BGP routers communicate witheach other by establishing TCP connections.Operating this way provides reliablecommunication and also hides all the details of the network being passed through.An example of howBGP routes are advertised is shown in Fig.5-69. Thereare three ASes and the middle one is providing transit to the left and right ISPs.Aroute advertisement to prefixCstarts inAS3.When it is propagated across the linktoR2cat the top of the figure, it has the AS path of simplyAS3and the next hoprouter ofR3a.Atthe bottom, it has the same AS path but a different next hop be-cause it came across a different link.This advertisement continues to propagateand crosses the boundary intoAS1.AtrouterR1a,atthe top of the figure, the ASpath isAS2,AS3and the next hop isR2a.Carrying the complete path with the route makes it easy for the receivingrouter to detect and break routing loops.The rule is that each router that sends aroute outside of the AS prepends its own AS number to the route. (This is whythelist is in reverse order.) Whenarouter receivesaroute, it checks to see if its ownAS number is already in the AS path. If it is, a loop has been detected and theadvertisement is discarded.However, and somewhat ironically,itwas realized inthe late 1990s that despite this precaution BGP suffers from a version of the count-to-infinity problem (Labovitz et al., 2001).There are no long-livedloops, butroutes can sometimes be slowtoconvergeand have transient loops.Giving a list of ASes is a very coarse way to specify a path.An AS might be asmall company, oraninternational backbone network. There is no way of tellingfrom the route.BGP does not eventry because different ASes may use differentintradomain protocols whose costs cannot be compared. Even if theycould becompared, an AS may not want to reveal its internal metrics. This is one of theways that interdomain routing protocols differ from intradomain protocols.'),\n",

Westill need some way to propagate BGP routes from one side of theISP to the other,sotheycan be sent on to the next ISP.This task could be handledby the intradomain protocol, but because BGP is very good at scaling to large net-works, a variant of BGP is often used. It is callediBGP(internal BGP)todistin-guish it from the regular use of BGP aseBGP(external BGP).The rule for propagating routes inside an ISP is that every router at the bound-ary of the ISP learns of all the routes seen by all the other boundary routers, forconsistency. Ifone boundary router on the ISP learns of a prefix to IP128.208.0.0/16, all the other routers will learn of this prefix. The prefix will thenbe reachable from all parts of the ISP,nomatter howpackets enter the ISP fromother ASes.We havenot shown this propagation in Fig.5-69 to avoid clutter,but, for ex-ample, routerR2bwill knowthat it can reachCvia either routerR2cat top orrouterR2dat bottom.The next hop is updated as the route crosses within the ISPso that routers on the far side of the ISP knowwhich router to use to exit the ISPon the other side. This can be seen in the leftmost routes in which the next hoppoints to a router in the same ISP and not a router in the next ISP.We can nowdescribe the key missing piece, which is howBGP routers choosewhich route to use for each destination. Each BGP router may learn a route for agivendestination from the router it is connected to in the next ISP and from all ofthe other boundary routers (which have heard different routes from the routers theyare connected to in other ISPs). Each router must decide which route in this set ofroutes is the best one to use.Ultimately the answer is that it is up to the ISP towrite some policytopick the preferred route.However, this explanation is verygeneral and not so satisfying, so we can at least describe some common strategies.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 512}, page_content='SEC. 5.7 THE NETWORK LAYER IN THE INTERNET 489The first strategy is that routes via peered networks are chosen in preference toroutes via transit providers. The former are free; the latter cost money. A similarstrategy is that customer routes are giventhe highest preference. It is only goodbusiness to send trafficdirectly to the paying customers.Adifferent kind of strategy is the default rule that shorter AS paths are better.This is debatable since an AS could be a network of anysize, so a path throughthree small ASes could actually be shorter than a path through one big AS. Howev-er,shorter tends to be better on average, and this rule is a common tiebreaker.The final strategy is to prefer the route that has the lowest cost within the ISP.This is the strategy implemented in Fig.5-69. Packets sent fromAtoCexitAS1atthe top router,R1a.Packets sent fromBexit via the bottom router,R1b.The rea-son is that bothAandBare taking the lowest-cost path or quickest route out ofAS1.Because theyare located in different parts of the ISP,the quickest exit foreach one is different. Thesame thing happens as the packets pass throughAS2.On the last leg,AS3has to carry the packet fromBthrough its own network.This strategy is known asearly exitorhot-potato routing.Ithas the curiousside effect of tending to makeroutes asymmetric.Forexample, consider the pathtaken whenCsends a packet back toB.The packet will exitAS3quickly,atthetop router,toavoid wasting its resources. Similarly,itwill stay at the top whenAS2passes it toAS1as quickly as possible. Then the packet will have a longer journeyinAS1.This is a mirror image of the path taken fromBtoC.The above discussion should makeclear that each BGP router chooses its ownbest route from the known possibilities. It is not the case, as might naively be ex-pected, that BGP chooses a path to followatthe AS leveland OSPF chooses pathswithin each of the ASes. BGP and the interior gatewayprotocol are integratedmuch more deeply.This means that, for example, BGP can find the best exit pointfrom one ISP to the next and this point will vary across the ISP,asinthe case ofthe hot-potato policy. Italso means that BGP routers in different parts of one ASmay choose different AS paths to reach the same destination.Care must be exer-cised by the ISP to configure all of the BGP routers to makecompatible choicesgivenall of this freedom, but this can be done in practice.The above policies are implemented with a variety of protocol configurationsand settings. The main aspect of the mechanics that is worth understanding is theroute selection process, which allows a router to select a route to an Internet desti-nation, givenmultiple options.Route selection proceeds in the following steps:1. Preferthe route with the highest local preference value.2. Preferthe route with the shortest AS path length.3. Preferroutes learned via external connections (i.e., via eBGP) overthose learned from internal connections (i.e., via iBGP).4. Amongroutes learned from the same neighboring AS, prefer routeswith the lowest multiple exit discriminator (MED) value.'),\n",

Preferroutes with the shortest IGP path cost to the next-hope IP ad-dress in the BGP route (where the next-hop IP address is typicallythat of the border router).These route selection steps proceed in sequence until the router chooses a singleroute for each IP prefix. The router performs the above process for each IP prefixin its routing table.Although this ordering seems lengthyand complicated, it isfairly intuitive.Thelocal preferencevalue for each route is a value that the localnetwork operator can set, and it remains internal to that AS. Because it has thehighest precedence among route selection rules, it allows an operator to implementthe types of route preferences and priorities that we discussed earlier in this section(e.g., preferring a route learned from a customer overasettlement-free route).After that rule, the others generally involveselection of short routes, as well as awaytoimplement early exit routing, as previously described. For example, thepreference for a route learned from an external AS overaninternal router is an at-tempt to implement early exit. Similarly,apreference for a route with a shortestIGP path cost to the border router is also an attempt to implement early exit.Amazingly,wehaveonly scratched the surface of BGP.For more information,see the BGP version 4 specification in RFC 427 and related RFCs.However, real-ize that much of its complexity lies with policies, which are not described in thespecification of the BGP protocol.Interdomain Traffic EngineeringAs previously described in this chapter,network operators often need to tunethe parameters and configuration of network protocols to manage utilization andcongestion. Such trafficengineering practices are common with BGP,where an op-erator may want to control howBGP selects routes to control howtrafficenters thenetwork (inbound traffic engineering)orhow itleavesthe network (outboundtraffic engineering)The most common way to perform inbound trafficengineering is by adjustinghowrouters set the local preference attribute for individual routes.By setting ahigher local preference value for all routes learned from a particular customer AS,for example, an operator can ensure that that customer’sroutes are picked over,say,atransit route wheneverthe customer route exists. Inboundtrafficengineeringis trickier,because BGP does not let one AS tell another AS howtoselect routes(hence the name, autonomous).Nevertheless, an operator can send indirect signalsto routers in neighboring networks to control howthese routers select routes. Onecommon way to do this is to artificially inflate the length of the AS path by re-peating the network’sown AS multiple times in the route announcement, a practicecalledAS path prepending.Another approach is to leverage longest prefix matchand simply split a prefix into multiple smaller (longer) prefixes, so that upstreamrouters prefer the routes with longer prefixes.

Thisapproach has some cost, however, asitcan makethe routing tables larger,andbeyond a certain length, routers will filter the announcements.5.7.8 Internet MulticastingNormal IP communication is between one sender and one receiver. However,for some applications, it is useful for a process to be able to send to a large numberof receivers simultaneously.Examples are streaming a live sports event to manyviewers, delivering program updates to a pool of replicated servers, and handlingdigital conference (i.e., multiparty) telephone calls.IP supports one-to-manycommunication, or multicasting, using class D IP ad-dresses. Eachclass D address identifies a group of hosts.Twenty-eight bits areavailable for identifying groups, so over250 million groups can exist at the sametime. Whenaprocess sends a packet to a class D address, a best-effort attempt ismade to deliverittoall the members of the group addressed, but no guarantees aregiven. Somemembers may not get the packet.The range of IP addresses 224.0.0.0/24 is reserved for multicast on the localnetwork. In this case, no routing protocol is needed. The packets are multicast bysimply broadcasting them on the LAN with a multicast address. All hosts on theLAN receive the broadcasts, and hosts that are members of the group process thepacket. Routersdo not forward the packet offthe LAN.Some examples of localmulticast addresses are:224.0.0.1 Allsystems on a LAN224.0.0.2 Allrouters on a LAN224.0.0.5 AllOSPF routers on a LAN224.0.0.251 All DNS servers on a LANOther multicast addresses may have members on different networks. Inthiscase, a routing protocol is needed. But first, the multicast routers need to knowwhich hosts are members of a group.Aprocess asks its host to join in a specificgroup. Itcan also ask its host to leave the group.Each host keeps track of whichgroups its processes currently belong to.When the last process on a host leavesagroup, the host is no longer a member of that group.About once a minute or so,each multicast router sends a query packet to all the hosts on its LAN (using thelocal multicast address of 224.0.0.1, of course) asking them to report back on thegroups to which theycurrently belong.The multicast routers may or may not becolocated with the standard routers.Each host sends back responses for all theclass D addresses it is interested in.These query and response packets use a proto-col calledIGMP(Internet Group Management Protocol). Itis described inRFC 3376.Anyofseveral multicast routing protocols may be used to build multicastspanning trees that give paths from senders to all of the members of the group.'),\n",

Within anAS, the main protocol used isPIM(Protocol Independent Multicast). PIMcomes in several flavors. In Dense Mode PIM, a pruned reverse path forwardingtree is created. This is suited to situations in which members are everywhere in thenetwork, such as distributing files to manyservers within a data center network. InSparse Mode PIM, spanning trees that are built are similar to core-based trees. Thisis suited to situations such as a content provider multicasting TV to subscribers onits IP network. Avariant of this design, called Source-Specific Multicast PIM, isoptimized for the case that there is only one sender to the group.Finally,multicastextensions to BGP or tunnels need to be used to create multicast routes when thegroup members are in more than one AS.5.8 POLICYAT THE NETWORK LAYERTrafficmanagement has become a topic related to policyinrecent years, asstreaming video traffichas become a dominant fraction of overall trafficand Inter-net interconnection has increasingly become direct between content providers andaccess networks. Two aspects of the network layer that relate to policyare peeringdisputes and trafficprioritization (sometimes associated withnet neutrality). Wewill discuss each of these aspects below.5.8.1 Peering DisputesAlthough BGP is a technical standard, ultimately interconnection amounts torouting money. Trafficflows along paths that makeservice provider and transit net-works the most money; paying for transit is considered a last resort. Settlement-free peering of course depends on both parties agreeing that interconnection ismutually beneficial. When one network feels it is getting the short end of the bar-gain, it can ask the other network to pay.The other connecting network mightagree, or refuse, but if negotiations break down, this results in a so-calledpeeringdispute.Avery high-profile peering dispute occurred a fewyears ago.In recent years,large content providers have been serving enough traffictocongest anyintercon-nect link. In 2013, large video providers were congesting interconnect links be-tween transit providers and residential access networks. Ultimately,the streamingvideo trafficfilled the capacity of these links, creating high utilization on intercon-nection links that was difficult for access networks to mitigate without provision-ing extra capacity.The question then became one of who should pay for augment-ing the network capacity.Inthe end, in manycases, the large content providersended up paying the access networks for direct interconnection, effectively a paidpeering arrangement as discussed earlier in this chapter.Manywrongly construed'),\n",

In fact, the incidents resulted from business disputes concerningwhich network should be responsible for paying to provision interconnectionpoints. For more information on peering disputes and howtheyare handled, seeThe Peering Playbook (Norton, 2012).Peering disputes are as old as the commercial Internet. As a higher fraction oftrafficonthe Internet goes overprivate interconnects, however, the nature of thesedisputes is likely to evolve. For example, residential access networks nowsend avery high fraction of their own traffictothe same distributed clouds where othercontent is hosted. Thus, it is not in their interests to let the interconnects to thosedistributed cloud platforms experience high utilization. Recently,some operatorshave gone so far as to predict the death of transit connections entirely (Huston,2018). Whether that comes to pass remains to be seen, but needless to say the dy-namics of peering, interconnection, and transit continue to evolverapidly.5.8.2 Traffic PrioritizationTrafficprioritization, of the types that we have discussed earlier in this chapter,is a complicated topic that sometimes crosses overinto the policyrealm. On theone hand, a core aspect of trafficmanagement is the prioritization of latency-sensi-tive traffic(e.g., gaming and interactive video) so that high utilization for othertypes of traffic(e.g., a large file transfer) does not result in poor overall user expe-rience. Some applications such as file transfers do not require interactivity,whereasinteractive applications often require lowlatencyand jitter.To achieve good performance for a mix of application traffic, network opera-tors often institute various forms of trafficprioritization, including methods such asthe weighted fair queueing approaches described earlier in this chapter.Addi-tionally,aspreviously discussed, newer versions of DOCSIS will have support forplacing interactive application trafficinlow-latencyqueues. Differentiated treat-ment across different types of application trafficcan in fact result in improvedquality of experience for certain applications without negatively affecting the qual-ity of experience for other classes of applications.Prioritization starts to get messier,however, ifand when moneychanges hands.The third rail in Internet policyispaid prioritization,whereby one party mightpay an Internet service provider so that its trafficwould receive higher priority thanother competing trafficofthe same application type. Such paid prioritization mightbe viewed as anti-competitive behavior.Inother cases, a transit network with a par-ticular service offering (e.g., video, or voice overIP) could prioritize its own ser-vice with respect to services from competitors. For example, in one instance,AT&T,was found to be blocking FaceTime video calls.Forthese reasons, prioriti-zation can often be a sensitive flash point in discussions aboutnetwork neutralityornet neutrality.The concept of net neutrality has complexlegaland policy'),\n",

Disclosureof anyprioritization practices.Anynet neutrality policyalso generally allows exceptions for reasonable networkmanagement practices (e.g., prioritization to improve network efficiency, blockingor filtering for network security reasons). What constitutes ‘‘reasonable’’isoftenleft up to lawyers to decide. Another policyand legalquestion is who (i.e., whatgovernment agency) gets to decide what the rules are, and what the penaltiesshould be for breaking them. Some aspects of the net neutrality policydebates inthe United States, for example, are about whether an Internet service provider ismore similar to a telephone utility company(e.g., AT&T) or to an information andcontent provider (e.g., Google). Depending on the answer to that question, dif-ferent government agencies get to set the rules on everything from prioritization toprivacy.5.9 SUMMARYThe network layer provides services to the transport layer.Itcan be based oneither datagrams or virtual circuits.In both cases, its main job is routing packetsfrom the source to the destination.In datagram networks, a routing decision ismade on every packet. Invirtual-circuit networks, it is made when the virtual cir-cuit is set up.Manyrouting algorithms are used in computer networks. Floodingis a simplealgorithm to send a packet along all paths.Most algorithms find the shortest pathand adapt to changes in the network topology.The main algorithms are distancevector routing and link state routing. Most actual networks use one of these.Otherimportant routing topics are the use of hierarchyinlarge networks, routing formobile hosts, and broadcast, multicast, and anycast routing.Networks can easily become congested, leading to increased delay and lostpackets. Network designers attempt to avoid congestion by designing the networkto have enough capacity,configuring the protocols to prefer uncongested routes,refusing to accept more traffic, signaling sources to slowdown, and shedding load.The next step beyond just dealing with congestion is to actually try to achieveapromised quality of service.Some applications care more about throughputwhereas others care more about delay and jitter.The methods that can be used toprovide different qualities of service include a combination of trafficshaping,'),\n",

Different networks may run differentrouting protocols internally but need to run a common protocol externally.Some-times the problems can be finessed by tunneling a packet through a hostile net-work, but if the source and destination networks use different technologies, this ap-proach fails.The Internet has a rich variety of protocols related to the network layer.Theseinclude the datagram protocol, IP,and associated control protocols such as ICMP,ARP,and DHCP.Aconnection-oriented protocol called MPLS carries IP packetsacross some networks. Oneof the main routing protocols used within networks isOSPF,and the routing protocol used across networks is BGP.The Internet is ra-pidly running out of IP addresses, so a newversion of IP,IPv6, has been developedand is ever-so-slowly being deployed.Some aspects of trafficengineering and management touch on policy-relatedissues. Two common issues are peering disputes, where networks cannot agree onthe business terms of interconnection; and trafficprioritization, which is generallyapplied to mitigate adverse effects of congestion but can touch on issues related tonetwork neutrality if it is applied in anti-competitive ways.PROBLEMS1.Give two example computer applications for which connection-oriented service is ap-propriate.

Inboth cases, connections have three phases: establishment, data transfer,and release.Addressing and flowcontrol are also similar in both layers.Furthermore, theconnectionless transport service is also very similar to the connectionless networkservice. However, note that it can be difficult to provide a connectionless transportservice on top of a connection-oriented network service, since it is inefficient to setup a connection to send a single packet and then tear it down immediately after-wards.The obvious question is this: if the transport layer service is so similar to thenetwork layer service, whyare there twodistinct layers?Whyisone layer not ade-quate? Theanswer is subtle, but really crucial.The transport code runs entirely on'),\n",

Whathappens if the net-work layer offers inadequate service?What if it frequently loses packets? Whathappens if routers crash from time to time?Problems occur,that’swhat. Theusers have noreal control overthe networklayer,sotheycannot solvethe problem of poor service by using better routers orputting more error handling in the data link layer because theydon’town the rout-ers. Theonly possibility is to put on top of the network layer another layer that im-provesthe quality of the service.If, in a connectionless network, packets are lostor mangled, the transport entity can detect the problem and compensate for it byusing retransmissions.If, in a connection-oriented network, a transport entity isinformed halfway through a long transmission that its network connection has beenabruptly terminated, with no indication of what has happened to the data currentlyin transit, it can set up a newnetwork connection to the remote transport entity.Using this newnetwork connection, it can send a query to its peer asking whichdata arrivedand which did not, and knowing where it was, pick up from where itleft off.In essence, the existence of the transport layer makes it possible for the tran-sport service to be more reliable than the underlying network, which may not be allthat reliable.Furthermore, the transport primitivescan be implemented as calls tolibrary procedures to makethem independent of the network primitives. Thenet-work service calls may vary considerably from one network to another (e.g., callsbased on a connectionless Ethernet may be quite different from calls on a con-nection-oriented network). Hidingthe network service behind a set of transportservice primitivesensures that changing the network merely requires replacing oneset of library procedures with another one that does the same thing with a differentunderlying service.Having applications be independent of the network layer is agood thing.Thanks to the transport layer,application programmers can write code accord-ing to a standard set of primitivesand have these programs work on a wide varietyof networks, without having to worry about dealing with different network inter-faces and levels of reliability.Ifall real networks were flawless and all had thesame service primitivesand were guaranteed never, evertochange, the transportlayer might not be needed.However, inthe real world it fulfills the key function ofisolating the upper layers from the technology,design, and imperfections of thenetwork.Forthis reason, manypeople have made a qualitative distinction between lay-ers one through four on the one hand and layer(s) above four on the other.Thebottom four layers can be seen as thetransport service provider,whereas theupper layer(s) are thetransport service user.This distinction of provider versususer has a considerable impact on the design of the layers and puts the transportlayer in a key position, since it forms the major boundary between the provider anduser of the reliable data transmission service.It is the levelthat applications see.'),\n",

Inthis section, we will first examine asimple (hypothetical) transport service and its interface to see the bare essentials.In the following section, we will look at a real example.The transport service is similar to the network service, but there are also someimportant differences. Themain difference is that the network service is intendedto model the service offered by real networks, warts and all.Real networks canlose packets, so the network service is generally unreliable.The connection-oriented transport service, in contrast, is reliable.Of course,real networks are not error-free, but that is precisely the purpose of the transportlayer—to provide a reliable service on top of an unreliable network.As an example, consider twoprocesses on a single machine connected by apipe in UNIX (or anyother interprocess communication facility). Theyassume theconnection between them is 100% perfect.Theydonot want to knowabout ac-knowledgements, lost packets, congestion, or anything at all likethat. Whattheywant is a 100% reliable connection.ProcessAputs data into one end of the pipe,and processBtakes it out of the other.This is what the connection-oriented tran-sport service is all about—hiding the imperfections of the network service so thatuser processes can just assume the existence of an error-free bit stream evenwhentheyare on different machines.As an aside, the transport layer can also provide unreliable (datagram) service.However, there is relatively little to say about that besides ‘‘it’sdatagrams,’’ sowewill mainly concentrate on the connection-oriented transport service in this chap-ter.Nevertheless, there are some applications, such as client-server computing andstreaming multimedia, that build on a connectionless transport service, and we willsay a little bit about that later on.Asecond difference between the network service and transport service iswhom the services are intended for.From the perspective ofnetwork endpoints,the network service is used only by the transport entities.Fewusers write theirowntransport entities, and thus fewusers or programs eversee the bare networkservice. Incontrast, manyprograms (and thus programmers) see the transportprimitives. Consequently,the transport service must be convenient and easy to use.To get an idea of what a transport service might be like, consider the fiveprim-itiveslisted in Fig.6-2. Thistransport interface is truly bare bones, but it givestheessential flavorofwhat a connection-oriented transport interface has to do.It al-lows application programs to establish, use, and then release connections, which issufficient for manyapplications.To see howthese primitivesmight be used, consider an application with a ser-verand a number of remote clients.To start with, the server executes aLISTENprimitive,typically by calling a library procedure that makes a system call that'),\n",

Thatterm is not usedmuch anymore nowbut you may see it in older papers and books.Thus, segments (exchanged by the transport layer) are contained in packets(which are exchanged by the network layer).In turn, these packets are containedin frames (exchanged by the data link layer).When a frame arrives, the data linklayer processes the frame header and, if the destination address matches for localdelivery,passes the contents of the frame payload field up to the network entity.The network entity similarly processes the packet header and then passes the con-tents of the packet payload up to the transport entity.This nesting is illustrated inFig. 6-3.FrameheaderPacketheaderSegmentheaderSegment payload\\nFrame payloadPacket payload\\nFigure6-3.Nesting of segments, packets, and frames.Getting back to our client-server example, the client’sCONNECTcall causes aCONNECTION REQUESTsegment to be sent to the server.When it arrives, thetransport entity checks to see that the server is blocked on aLISTEN(i.e., is ready to'),\n",

Inthesimplest form, either party can do a (blocking)RECEIVEto wait for the other partyto do aSEND.When the segment arrives, the receiverisunblocked. Itcan thenprocess the segment and send a reply.Aslong as both sides can keep track ofwhose turn it is to send, this scheme works fine.In the transport layer,evenasimple unidirectional data exchange is more com-plicated than at the network layer.Every data packet sent will also be acknow-ledged (eventually). Thepackets bearing control segments are also acknowledged,implicitly or explicitly.These acknowledgements are managed by the transport en-tities, using the network layer protocol, and are not visible to the transport users.Similarly,the transport entities need to worry about timers and retransmissions.None of this machinery is visible to the transport users.To the transport users, aconnection is a reliable bit pipe: one end stuffs bits in and theymagically appear inthe same order at the other end.This ability to hide complexity is the reason thatlayered protocols are such a powerful tool.When a connection is no longer needed, it must be released to free up tablespace within the twotransport entities.Disconnection has twovariants: asymmet-ric and symmetric.In the asymmetric variant, either transport user can issue aDIS-CONNECTprimitive,which results in aDISCONNECTsegment being sent to the re-mote transport entity.Upon its arrival, the connection is released.In the symmetric variant, each direction is closed separately,independently ofthe other one.When one side does aDISCONNECT,that means it has no more datato send but it is still willing to accept data from its partner.Inthis model, a con-nection is released when both sides have done aDISCONNECT.Astate diagram for connection establishment and release for these simpleprimitivesisgiveninFig. 6-4.Each transition is triggered by some event, either aprimitive executed by the local transport user or an incoming packet. For simpli-city,weassume here that each segment is separately acknowledged. Wealso as-sume that a symmetric disconnection model is used, with the client going first.Please note that this model is quite unsophisticated.We will look at more realisticmodels later on when we describe howTCP works.6.1.3 Berkeley SocketsLet us nowbriefly inspect another set of transport primitives, the socket primi-tivesastheyare used for TCP.Sockets were first released as part of the BerkeleyUNIX 4.2BSD software distribution in 1983.

Thestandard UNIXREADandWRITEsystem callscan also be used if none of the special options ofSENDandRECEIVEare required.Connection release with sockets is symmetric.When both sides have executedaCLOSEprimitive,the connection is released.Sockets have provedtremendously popular and are the de facto standard forabstracting transport services to applications.The socket API is often used withthe TCP protocol to provide a connection-oriented service called areliable bytestream,which is simply the reliable bit pipe that we described.However, otherprotocols could be used to implement this service using the same API.It shouldall be the same to the transport service users.Astrength of the socket API is that is can be used by an application for othertransport services.Forinstance, sockets can be used with a connectionless tran-sport service. In this case,CONNECTsets the address of the remote transport peerandSENDandRECEIVEsend and receive datagrams to and from the remote peer.(It is also common to use an expanded set of calls, for example,SENDTOandRECVFROM,that emphasize messages and do not limit an application to a singletransport peer.)

Forexample, applications often work with a group of related streams, such as a Webbrowser that requests several objects from the same server.With sockets, the mostnatural fit is for application programs to use one stream per object. This structuremeans that congestion control is applied separately for each stream, not across thegroup, which is suboptimal.It punts to the application the burden of managing theset. Someprotocols and interfaces have been devised that support groups of relat-ed streams more effectively and simply for the application.Twoexamples areSCTP(Stream Control Transmission Protocol)defined in RFC 4960 (Ford,2007) and QUIC (discussed later).These protocols must change the socket APIslightly to get the benefits of groups of related streams, and theyalso support fea-tures such as a mix of connection-oriented and connectionless trafficand evenmul-tiple network paths.6.1.4 AnExample of Socket Programming: An Internet File ServerAs an example of the nitty-gritty of howreal socket calls are made, considerthe client and server code of Fig.6-6. Herewe have a very primitive Internet fileserver along with an example client that uses it.The code has manylimitations(discussed below), but in principle the server code can be compiled and run on anyUNIX system connected to the Internet.The client code can be compiled and runon anyother UNIX machine on the Internet, anywhere in the world. Theclientcode can be executed with appropriate parameters to fetch anyfile to which theserver has access on its machine.The file is written to standard output, which, ofcourse, can be redirected to a file or pipe.Let us look at the server code first. Itstarts out by including some standardheaders, the last three of which contain the main Internet-related definitions anddata structures.Next comes a definition ofSERVERPORTas 8080.This numberwaschosen arbitrarily.Any number between 1024 and 65535 will work just aswell, as long as it is not in use by some other process; ports below1023 are re-served for privileged users.The next twolines in the server define constants.The first one determines thechunk size in bytes used for the file transfer.The second one determines howmanypending connections can be held before additional ones are discarded.After the declarations of local variables, the server code begins. Itstarts out byinitializing a data structure that will hold the server’sIPaddress. Thisdata struc-ture will soon be bound to the server’ssocket. Thecall tomemsetsets the datastructure to all 0s.The three assignments following it fill in three of its fields. Thelast of these contains the server’sport. Thefunctionshtonlandhtonshave todowith converting values to a standard format so the code runs correctly on both lit-tle-endian machines (e.g., Intel x86) and big-endian machines (e.g., the SPARC).'),\n",

Theonlywaytostop it is to kill it from outside.The call toacceptblocks the server untilsome client tries to establish a connection with it.If theacceptcall succeeds, it re-turns a socket descriptor that can be used for reading and writing, analogous tohowfile descriptors can be used to read from and write to pipes.However, unlikepipes, which are unidirectional, sockets are bidirectional, sosa(the acceptedsocket) can be used for reading from the connection and also for writing to it.Apipe file descriptor is for reading or writing but not both.After the connection is established, the server reads the file name from it.Ifthe name is not yet available, the server blocks waiting for it.After getting the filename, the server opens the file and enters a loop that alternately reads blocks fromthe file and writes them to the socket until the entire file has been copied.Then theserver closes the file and the connection and waits for the next connection to showup.

Notethatargv[1] contains the name of the server (e.g.,flits.cs.vu.nl)and is converted toan IP address bygethostbyname.This function uses DNS to look up the name.Wewill studyDNS in Chap.7.Next, a socket is created and initialized.After that, the client attempts toestablish a TCP connection to the server,usingconnect.Ifthe server is up andrunning on the named machine and attached toSERVERPORTand is either idleor has room in itslistenqueue, the connection will (eventually) be established.Using the connection, the client sends the name of the file by writing on the socket.'),\n",

Itserrorchecking is meager and its error reporting is mediocre.Since it handles all re-quests strictly sequentially (because it has only a single thread), its performance ispoor.Ithas clearly neverheard about security,and using bare UNIX system callsis not the way to gain platform independence.It also makes some assumptions thatare technically illegal, such as assuming that the file name fits in the buffer and istransmitted atomically.These shortcomings notwithstanding, it is a working Inter-net file server.For more information about using sockets, see Donahoo andCalvert (2008, 2009); and Stevens et al. (2004).6.2 ELEMENTSOF TRANSPORTPROTOCOLSThe transport service is implemented by atransport protocolused betweenthe twotransport entities.In some ways, transport protocols resemble the data linkprotocols we studied in detail in Chap. 3.Both have todeal with error control,sequencing, and flowcontrol, among other issues.However, significant differences between the twoalso exist. Thesedifferencesare due to major dissimilarities between the environments in which the twoproto-cols operate, as shown in Fig.6-7. Atthe data link layer,two routers communicatedirectly via a physical channel, whether wired or wireless, whereas at the transportlayer,this physical channel is replaced by the entire network. Thisdifference hasmanyimportant implications for the protocols.Router Router\\nPhysicalcommunication channel Host(a) (b)\\nNetwork\\nFigure6-7.(a) Environment of the data link layer.(b) Environment of thetransport layer.Forone thing, overpoint-to-point links such as wires or optical fiber,itisusually not necessary for a router to specify which router it wants to talk to—each'),\n",

Justsending a message is sufficient to have itreach all other destinations. If the message is not acknowledged due to an error,itcan be resent.In the transport layer,initial connection establishment is complicat-ed, as we will see.Another (exceedingly annoying) difference between the data link layer and thetransport layer is the potential existence of storage capacity in the network. Whenarouter sends a packet overalink, it may arrive orbelost, but it cannot bouncearound for a while, go into hiding in a far corner of the world, and suddenlyemerge after other packets that were sent much later.Ifthe network uses data-grams, which are independently routed inside, there is a nonnegligible probabilitythat a packet may takethe scenic route and arrive late and out of the expectedorder,oreventhat duplicates of the packet will arrive.The consequences of thenetwork’sability to delay and duplicate packets can sometimes be disastrous andcan require the use of special protocols to correctly transport information.Afinal difference between the data link and transport layers is one of degreerather than of kind.Buffering and flowcontrol are needed in both layers, but thepresence in the transport layer of a large and varying number of connections withbandwidth that fluctuates as the connections compete with each other may requireadifferent approach than we used in the data link layer.Some of the protocols dis-cussed in Chap. 3 allocate a fixed number of buffers to each line, so that when aframe arrivesabuffer is always available. Inthe transport layer,the larger numberof connections that must be managed and variations in the bandwidth each con-nection may receive makethe idea of dedicating manybuffers to each one lessattractive.Inthe following sections, we will examine all of these important issues,and others.6.2.1 AddressingWhen an application process wishes to set up a connection to a remote applica-tion process, it must specify which process on the remote endpoint to connect to.The method normally used is to define transport addresses to which processes canlisten for connection requests.In the Internet, these endpoints are calledports.We will use the generic termTSAP(Transport Service Access Point)tomean aspecific endpoint in the transport layer.The analogous endpoints in the networklayer (i.e., network layer addresses) are not-surprisingly calledNSAPs(NetworkService Access Points). IPaddresses are examples of NSAPs.Figure 6-8 illustrates the relationship between the NSAPs, the TSAPs, and atransport connection using them.Application processes, both clients and servers,'),\n",

Ifyou do not knowthe num-ber of the information operator,you cannot call the information operator to find itout. Ifyou think the number you dial for information is obvious, try it in a foreigncountry sometime.Manyofthe server processes that can exist on a machine will be used onlyrarely.Itiswasteful to have each of them active and listening to a stable TSAPaddress all day long.An alternative scheme is shown in Fig.6-9 in a simplifiedform. Itis known as theinitial connection protocol.Instead of every conceivableserver listening at a well-known TSAP,each machine that wishes to offer servicesto remote users has a specialprocess serverthat acts as a proxy for less heavilyused servers. Thisserver is calledinetdon UNIX systems.It listens to a set ofports at the same time, waiting for a connection request.Potential users of a ser-vice begin by doing aCONNECTrequest, specifying the TSAP address of the ser-vice theywant. Ifno server is waiting for them, theyget a connection to the proc-ess server,asshown in Fig. 6-9(a).'),\n",

Atfirst glance, it would seem sufficient for one transport entity to just send aCON-NECTION REQUESTsegment to the destination and wait for aCONNECTIONACCEPTEDreply.The problem occurs when the network can lose, delay,corrupt,and duplicate packets. Thisbehavior causes serious complications.Problem: Delayed and Duplicate PacketsImagine a network that is so congested that acknowledgements hardly evergetback in time and each packet times out and is retransmitted twoorthree or moretimes. Supposethat the network uses datagrams inside and that every packet fol-lows a different route.Some of the packets might get stuck in a trafficjam inside'),\n",

Auser establishes a connectionwith a bank, sends messages telling the bank to transfer a large amount of moneyto the account of a not-entirely-trustworthyperson. Unfortunately,the packetsdecide to takethe scenic route to the destination and go offexploring a remote cor-ner of the network. Thesender then times out and sends them all again. This timethe packets takethe shortest route and are delivered quickly so the sender releasesthe connection.Unfortunately,eventually the initial batch of packets finally come out of hidingand arrive atthe destination in order,asking the bank to establish a newconnectionand transfer money(again). Thebank has no way of telling that these are dupli-cates. Itmust assume that this is a second, independent transaction, and transfersthe moneyagain.This scenario may sound unlikely,orevenimplausible but the point is this:protocols must be designed to be correct in all cases. Only the common cases needbe implemented efficiently to obtain good network performance, but the protocolmust be able to cope with the uncommon cases without breaking. If it cannot, wehave built a fair-weather network that can fail without warning when the conditionsget tough.Forthe remainder of this section, we will study the problem of delayed dupli-cates, with emphasis on algorithms for establishing connections in a reliable way,so that nightmares likethe one above cannot happen.The crux of the problem isthat the delayed duplicates are thought to be newpackets. Wecannot prevent pack-ets from being duplicated and delayed. But if and when this happens, the packetsmust be rejected as duplicates and not processed as fresh packets.The problem can be attacked in various ways, none of them terribly satisfac-tory.One way is to use throwawaytransport addresses.In this approach, eachtime a transport address is needed, a brand newone is generated.When a con-nection is released, the address is discarded and neverused again. Delayeddupli-cate packets then neverfind their way to a transport process and can do no damage.However, this approach makes it more difficult to connect with a process in thefirst place.Another option is to give each connection a unique identifier (i.e., a sequencenumber incremented for each connection established) chosen by the initiating partyand put in each segment, including the one requesting the connection.After eachconnection is released, each transport entity can update a table listing obsolete con-nections as (peer transport entity,connection identifier) pairs.Wheneveracon-nection request comes in, it can be checked against the table to see if it belongs to apreviously released connection.Unfortunately,this scheme has a basic flaw: itrequires each transport entity tomaintain a certain amount of history information effectively indefinitely.This his-tory must persist at both the source and destination machines. Otherwise, if a'),\n",

Restrictednetwork design.2. Puttingahop counter in each packet.3. Timestamping each packet.The first technique includes anymethod that prevents packets from looping, com-bined with some way of bounding delay including congestion overthe (nowknown) longest possible path. It is difficult, giventhat internets may range from asingle city to international in scope.The second method consists of having the hopcount initialized to some appropriate value and decremented each time the packetis forwarded. Thenetwork protocol simply discards anypacket whose hop counterbecomes zero.The third method requires each packet to bear the time it was creat-ed, with the routers agreeing to discard anypacket older than some agreed-upontime. Thislatter method requires the router clocks to be synchronized, which itselfis a nontrivial task, and in practice a hop counter is a close enough approximationto age.In practice, we will need to guarantee not only that a packet is dead, but alsothat all acknowledgements to it are dead, too, so we will nowintroduce a periodT,which is some small multiple of the true maximum packet lifetime.The maximumpacket lifetime is a conservative constant for a network; for the Internet, it is some-what arbitrarily taken to be 120 seconds.The multiple is protocol dependent andsimply has the effect of makingTlonger.Ifwewait a timeTsecs after a packethas been sent, we can be sure that all traces of it are nowgone and that neither itnor its acknowledgements will suddenly appear out of the blue to complicate mat-ters.With packet lifetimes bounded, it is possible to devise a practical and foolproofwaytoreject delayed duplicate segments. Themethod described belowisdue toTomlinson (1975), as refined by Sunshine and Dalal (1978).Variants of it arewidely used in practice, including in TCP.The heart of the method is for the source to label segments with sequencenumbers that will not be reused withinTsecs. Theperiod,T,and the rate of pack-ets per second determine the size of the sequence numbers.In this way,only onepacket with a givensequence number may be outstanding at anygiventime. Dupli-cates of this packet may still occur,and theymust be discarded by the destination.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 543}, page_content='520 THE TRANSPORTLAYER CHAP.6However, itisnolonger the case that a delayed duplicate of an old packet may beatanew packet with the same sequence number and be accepted by the destination inits stead.To get around the problem of a machine losing all memory of where it wasafter a crash, one possibility is to require transport entities to be idle forTsecsafter a recovery.The idle period will let all old segments die off, so the sender canstart again with anysequence number.However, inacomplexinternetwork,Tmaybe large, so this strategy is unattractive.Instead, Tomlinson proposed equipping each host with a time-of-day clock.The clocks at different hosts need not be synchronized.Each clock is assumed totakethe form of a binary counter that increments itself at uniform intervals. Fur-thermore, the number of bits in the counter must equal or exceed the number ofbits in the sequence numbers.Last, and most important, the clock is assumed tocontinue running evenifthe host goes down.When a connection is set up, the low-orderk-bits of the clock are used as thek-bit initial sequence number.Thus, unlikeour protocols of Chap. 3, each connec-tion starts numbering its segments with a different initial sequence number.Thesequence space should be so large that by the time sequence numbers wrap around,old segments with the same sequence number are long gone.This linear relationbetween time and initial sequence numbers is shown in Fig.6-10(a). Theforbid-den region shows the times for which segment sequence numbers are illegallead-ing up to their use. If anysegment is sent with a sequence number in this region, itcould be delayed and impersonate a different packet with the same sequence num-ber that will be issued slightly later.For example, if the host crashes and restarts attime 70 seconds, it will use initial sequence numbers based on the clock to pick upafter it left off; the host does not start with a lower sequence number in the forbid-den region.Once both transport entities have agreed on the initial sequence number,anysliding windowprotocol can be used for data flowcontrol. Thiswindowprotocolwill correctly find and discard duplicates of packets after theyhavealready beenaccepted. Inreality,the initial sequence number curve(shown by the heavy line) isnot linear,but a staircase, since the clock advances in discrete steps.Forsimpli-city,wewill ignore this detail.To keep packet sequence numbers out of the forbidden region, we need to takecare in tworespects. Wecan get into trouble in twodistinct ways. If a host sendstoo much data too fast on a newly opened connection, the actual sequence numberversus time curvemay rise more steeply than the initial sequence number versustime curve, causing the sequence number to enter the forbidden region. Topreventthis from happening, the maximum data rate on anyconnection is one segment perclock tick.This also means that the transport entity must wait until the clock ticksbefore opening a newconnection after a crash restart, lest the same number beused twice.Both of these points argue in favorofashort clock tick (1µ sec orless). However, the clock cannot tick too fast relative tothe sequence number.For'),\n",

Avoiding this situation limits howslowly sequence numberscan advance on a connection (or howlong the connections may last).The clock-based method solves the problem of not being able to distinguishdelayed duplicate segments from newsegments. However, there is a practical snagfor using it for establishing connections. Since we do not normally remembersequence numbers across connections at the destination, we still have noway ofknowing if aCONNECTION REQUESTsegment containing an initial sequencenumber is a duplicate of a recent connection. This snag does not exist during a con-nection because the sliding windowprotocol does remember the current sequencenumber.Solution: Three-Way HandshakeTo solvethis specific problem, Tomlinson (1975) introduced thethree-wayhandshake.This establishment protocol involves one peer checking with the otherthat the connection request is indeed current.The normal setup procedure whenhost 1 initiates is shown in Fig.6-11(a).

Host2reacts to this segment by sending host 1anACKsegment, in effect asking for verification that host 1 was indeed trying toset up a newconnection.

Asin theprevious example, host 2 gets a delayedCONNECTION REQUESTand replies to it.At this point, it is crucial to realize that host 2 has proposed usingyas the initialsequence number for host 2 to host 1 traffic, knowing full well that no segmentscontaining sequence numberyor acknowledgements toyare still in existence.When the second delayed segment finally arrivesathost 2, the fact thatzhas beenacknowledged rather thanytells host 2 that this, too, is an old duplicate.Theimportant thing to realize here is that there is no combination of old segments thatcan cause the protocol to fail and have a connection set up by accident when noone wants it.TCP always uses this three-way handshaketoestablish connections.Within aconnection, a timestamp is used to extend the 32-bit sequence number so that itwill not wrap within the maximum packet lifetime, evenfor gigabit-per-secondconnections. Thismechanism is a fix to TCP that was needed as it was used onfaster and faster links. It is described in RFC 1323 and calledPAWS(ProtectionAgainst Wrapped Sequence numbers). Acrossconnections, for the initialsequence numbers and before PAWScan come into play,TCP originally used theclock-based scheme just described. However, this turned out to have a securityvulnerability.The clock made it easy for an attacker to predict the next initialsequence number and send packets that tricked the three-way handshakeand estab-lished a forged connection. Toclose this hole, pseudorandom initial sequence num-bers are used for connections in practice. However, itremains important that theinitial sequence numbers not repeat for an interval eventhough theyappear randomto an observer.Otherwise, delayed duplicates can wreak havoc.6.2.3 ConnectionReleaseReleasing a connection is easier than establishing one.Nevertheless, there aremore pitfalls than one might expect here.As we mentioned earlier,there are twostyles of terminating a connection: asymmetric release and symmetric release.Asymmetric release is the way the telephone system works: when one party hangsup, the connection is broken. Symmetricrelease treats the connection as twosepa-rate unidirectional connections and requires each one to be released separately.Asymmetric release is abrupt and may result in data loss.Consider the scen-ario of Fig.6-12. Afterthe connection is established, host 1 sends a segment thatarrivesproperly at host 2.Then host 1 sends another segment. Unfortunately,host2issues aDISCONNECTbefore the second segment arrives. Theresult is that theconnection is released and data are lost.Clearly,amore sophisticated release protocol is needed to avoid data loss.One way is to use symmetric release, in which each direction is released indepen-dently of the other one.Here, a host can continue to receive data evenafter it hassent aDISCONNECTsegment.'),\n",

Onecan envision a protocol in which host 1 says ‘‘I am done. Are you donetoo?’’Ifhost 2 responds: ‘‘I am done too. Goodbye, the connection can be safelyreleased.’’Unfortunately,this protocol does not always work. Thereis a famous problemthat illustrates this issue.It is called thetwo-army problem.Imagine that a whitearmy is encamped in a valley, asshown in Fig.6-13. Onboth of the surroundinghillsides are blue armies.The white army is larger than either of the blue armiesalone, but together the blue armies are larger than the white army.Ifeither bluearmy attacks by itself, it will be defeated, but if the twoblue armies attack simul-taneously,theywill be victorious.The blue armies want to synchronize their attacks.However, their only com-munication medium is to send messengers on foot down into the valley, where theymight be captured and the message lost (i.e., theyhaveto use an unreliable com-munication channel).The question is: does a protocol exist that allows the bluearmies to win?Suppose that the commander of blue army #1 sends a message reading: ‘‘I pro-pose we attack at dawn on March 29. Howabout it?’’Now suppose that the mes-sage arrives, the commander of blue army #2 agrees, and his reply gets safely backto blue army #1.Will the attack happen?Probably not, because commander #2does not knowifhis reply got through.If it did not, blue army #1 will not attack,so it would be foolish for him to charge into battle.Nowlet us improve the protocol by making it a three-way handshake. Theini-tiator of the original proposal must acknowledge the response.Assuming no mes-sages are lost, blue army #2 will get the acknowledgement, but the commander of'),\n",

Supposethat someprotocol did exist. Eitherthe last message of the protocol is essential, or it is not.If it is not, we can remove it(and anyother unessential messages) until we are leftwith a protocol in which every message is essential.What happens if the finalmessage does not get through?We just said that it was essential, so if it is lost, theattack does not takeplace. Sincethe sender of the final message can neverbesureof its arrival, he will not risk attacking.Worse yet, the other blue army knows this,so it will not attack either.To see the relevance of the two-army problem to releasing connections, ratherthan to military affairs, just substitute ‘‘disconnect’’for ‘‘attack.’’ Ifneither side isprepared to disconnect until it is convinced that the other side is prepared todisconnect too, the disconnection will neverhappen.In practice, we can avoid this quandary by foregoing the need for agreementand pushing the problem up to the transport user,letting each side independentlydecide when it is done.This is an easier problem to solve. Figure6-14 illustratesfour scenarios of releasing using a three-way handshake. Whilethis protocol is notinfallible, it is usually adequate.In Fig.6-14(a), we see the normal case in which one of the users sends aDR(DISCONNECTION REQUEST)segment to initiate the connection release.When itarrives, the recipient sends back aDRsegment and starts a timer,just in case itsDRis lost.When thisDRarrives, the original sender sends back anACKsegment andreleases the connection.Finally,when theACKsegment arrives, the receiveralsoreleases the connection.Releasing a connection means that the transport entity'),\n",

Ifwe do not allowthe receiving side to timeout, the protocol hangs in Fig. 6-14(d).One way to kill offhalf-open connections is to have a rule saying that if nosegments have arrivedfor a certain number of seconds, the connection is automat-ically disconnected.That way,ifone side everdisconnects, the other side willdetect the lack of activity and also disconnect.This rule also takes care of the casewhere the connection is broken (because the network can no longer deliverpacketsbetween the hosts) without either end disconnecting first.Of course, if this rule is introduced, it is necessary for each transport entity tohave a timer that is stopped and then restarted wheneverasegment is sent.If thistimer expires, a dummy segment is transmitted, just to keep the other side fromdisconnecting. Onthe other hand, if the automatic disconnect rule is used and toomanydummy segments in a roware lost on an otherwise idle connection, first oneside, then the other will automatically disconnect.We will not belabor this point anymore, but by nowitshould be clear thatreleasing a connection without data loss is not nearly as simple as it first appears.The lesson here is that the transport user must be involved in deciding when todisconnect—the problem cannot be cleanly solved by the transport entities them-selves. Tosee the importance of the application, consider that while TCP normallydoes a symmetric close (with each side independently closing its half of the con-nection with aFINpacket when it has sent its data), manyWeb servers send the cli-ent aRSTpacket that causes an abrupt close of the connection that is more likeanasymmetric close.This works only because the Web server knows the pattern ofdata exchange. First it receivesarequest from the client, which is all the data theclient will send, and then it sends a response to the client.When the Web server is finished with its response, all of the data has been sentin either direction.The server can send the client a warning and abruptly shut theconnection. If the client gets this warning, it will release its connection state thenand there.If the client does not get the warning, it will eventually realize that theserver is no longer talking to it and release the connection state. The data has beensuccessfully transferred in either case.'),\n",

Error control is ensuring that the data is deliv-ered with the desired levelofreliability,usually that all of the data is deliveredwithout anyerrors. Flowcontrol is keeping a fast transmitter from overrunning aslowreceiver.Both of these issues have come up before, when we studied the data link layer.The solutions that are used at the transport layer are the same mechanisms that westudied in Chap. 3. As a very brief recap:1. Aframe carries an error-detecting code (e.g., a CRC or checksum)that is used to check if the information was correctly received.2. Aframe carries a sequence number to identify itself and is retrans-mitted by the sender until it receivesanacknowledgement of suc-cessful receipt from the receiver. This is calledARQ(AutomaticRepeat reQuest).3. Thereis a maximum number of frames that the sender will allowtobe outstanding at anytime, pausing if the receiverisnot acknowledg-ing frames quickly enough.If this maximum is one packet the proto-col is calledstop-and-wait.Larger windows enable pipelining andimprove performance on long, fast links.4. Thesliding windowprotocol combines these features and is alsoused to support bidirectional data transfer.Giventhat these mechanisms are used on frames at the link layer,itisnaturalto wonder whytheywould be used on segments at the transport layer as well.However, there is little duplication between the link and transport layers in prac-tice. Even though the same mechanisms are used, there are differences in functionand degree.Foradifference in function, consider error detection.The link layer checksumprotects a frame while it crosses a single link. The transport layer checksum pro-tects a segment while it crosses an entire network path. It is an end-to-end check,which is not the same as having a check on every link.Saltzer et al. (1984) de-scribe a situation in which packets were corrupted inside a router.The link layerchecksums protected the packets only while theytraveled across a link, not whiletheywere inside the router.Thus, packets were delivered incorrectly eventhoughtheywere correct according to the checks on every link.This and other examples led Saltzer et al. to articulate what iscalled theend-to-end argument.According to this argument, the transport layer check that runsend-to-end is essential for correctness, and the link layer checks are not essential'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 552}, page_content='SEC. 6.2 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTPROTOCOLS 529butnonetheless valuable for improving performance (since without them a cor-rupted packet can be sent along the entire path unnecessarily).As a difference in degree, consider retransmissions and the sliding windowprotocol. Most wireless links, other than satellite links, can have only a singleframe outstanding from the sender at a time.That is, the bandwidth-delay productfor the link is small enough that not evenawhole frame can be stored inside thelink. In this case, a small windowsize is sufficient for good performance.Forexample, 802.11 uses a stop-and-wait protocol, transmitting or retransmitting eachframe and waiting for it to be acknowledged before moving on to the next frame.Having a windowsize larger than one frame would add complexity without im-proving performance.Forwired and optical fiber links, such as (switched) Ether-net or ISP backbones, the error-rate is lowenough that link-layer retransmissionscan be omitted because the end-to-end retransmissions will repair the residualframe loss.On the other hand, manyTCP connections have a bandwidth-delay productthat is much larger than a single segment. Consider a connection sending dataacross the U.S. at 1 Mbps with a round-trip time of 200 msec. Even for this slowconnection, 200 Kbit of data will be stored at the receiverinthe time it takes tosend a segment and receive anacknowledgement. For these situations, a large slid-ing windowmust be used. Stop-and-wait will cripple performance.In our exampleit would limit performance to one segment every 200 msec, or 5 segments/sec nomatter howfast the network really is.Giventhat transport protocols generally use larger sliding windows, we willlook at the issue of buffering data more carefully.Since a host may have manyconnections, each of which is treated separately,itmay need a substantial amountof buffering for the sliding windows. Thebuffers are needed at both the sender andthe receiver. Certainly theyare needed at the sender to hold all transmitted but asyet unacknowledged segments. Theyare needed there because these segments maybe lost and need to be retransmitted.However, since the sender is buffering, the receivermay or may not dedicatespecific buffers to specific connections, as it sees fit. Thereceivermay,for ex-ample, maintain a single buffer pool shared by all connections.When a segmentcomes in, an attempt is made to dynamically acquire a newbuffer.Ifone is avail-able, the segment is accepted; otherwise, it is discarded.Since the sender is pre-pared to retransmit segments lost by the network, no permanent harm is done byhaving the receiverdrop segments, although some resources are wasted. Thesend-er just keeps trying until it gets an acknowledgement.The best trade-offbetween source buffering and destination buffering dependson the type of trafficcarried by the connection.Forlow-bandwidth bursty traffic,such as that produced by a user typing at a remote computer,itisreasonable not todedicate anybuffers, but rather to acquire them dynamically at both ends, relyingon buffering at the sender if segments must occasionally be discarded.On theother hand, for file transfer and most other high-bandwidth traffic, it is better if the'),\n",

This is the strategy that TCP uses.There still remains the question of howtoorganize the buffer pool.If mostsegments are nearly the same size, it is natural to organize the buffers as a pool ofidentically sized buffers, with one segment per buffer,asinFig. 6-15(a).However,if there is wide variation in segment size, from short requests for Web pages tolarge packets in peer-to-peer file transfers, a pool of fixed-sized buffers presentsproblems. Ifthe buffer size is chosen to be equal to the largest possible segment,space will be wasted wheneverashort segment arrives.

(b)Chained variable-sized buffers.(c) One large circular buffer per connection.Another approach to the buffer size problem is to use variable-sized buffers, asin Fig.6-15(b). Theadvantage here is better memory utilization, at the price ofmore complicated buffer management.Athird possibility is to dedicate a singlelarge circular buffer per connection, as in Fig.6-15(c). Thissystem is simple andelegant and does not depend on segment sizes, but makes good use of memoryonly when the connections are heavily loaded.As connections are opened and closed and as the trafficpattern changes, thesender and receiverneed to dynamically adjust their buffer allocations.Conse-quently,the transport protocol should allowasending host to request buffer spaceat the other end.Buffers could be allocated per connection, or collectively,for allconnections running between the twohosts. Alternatively,the receiver, knowing'),\n",

Initially,the sender requests a certain number of buffers, based on its ex-pected needs.The receiverthen grants as manyofthese as it can afford. Everytime the sender transmits a segment, it must decrement its allocation, stopping alto-gether when the allocation reaches zero.The receiverseparately piggybacks bothacknowledgements and buffer allocations onto the reverse traffic. TCPuses thisscheme, carrying buffer allocations in a header field calledWindow size.Figure 6-16 has an example of howdynamic windowmanagement might workin a datagram network with 4-bit sequence numbers.In this example, data flows insegments from hostAto hostBand acknowledgements and buffer allocations flowin segments in the reverse direction.Initially,Awants eight buffers, but it is grant-ed only four of these.It then sends three segments, of which the third is lost.Seg-ment 6 acknowledges receipt of all segments up to and including sequence number1, thus allowingAto release those buffers, and furthermore informsAthat it haspermission to send three more segments starting beyond 1 (i.e., segments 2, 3, and4).Aknows that it has already sent number 2, so it thinks that it may send seg-ments 3 and 4, which it proceeds to do.At this point it is blocked and must waitfor more buffer allocation.Timeout-induced retransmissions (line 9), however,may occur while blocked, since theyuse buffers that have already been allocated.In line 10,Backnowledges receipt of all segments up to and including 4 but re-fuses to letAcontinue. Suchasituation is impossible with the fixed-windowpro-tocols of Chap. 3.The next segment fromBtoAallocates another buffer and al-lowsAto continue. This will happen whenBhas buffer space, likely because thetransport user has accepted more segment data.Problems with buffer allocation schemes of this kind can arise in datagram net-works if control segments can get lost—which theymost certainly can.Look atline 16.Bhas nowallocated more buffers toA,but the allocation segment waslost. Oops.Since control segments are not sequenced or timed out,Ais nowdead-locked. Toprevent this situation, each host should periodically send control seg-ments giving the acknowledgement and buffer status on each connection.Thatway, the deadlock will be broken, sooner or later.Until nowwehaveassumed that the only limit imposed on the sender’sdatarate is the amount of buffer space available in the receiver. This is often not thecase. Memory was once expensive but prices have fallen dramatically.Hosts maybe equipped with sufficient memory that the lack of buffers is rarely a problem,evenfor wide area connections. Of course, this depends on the buffer size being setto be large enough, which is not always the case for TCP (Zhang et al., 2002).'),\n",

Ifadjacent routers can exchange atmostxpackets/sec and there arekdisjoint paths between a pair of hosts, there is nowaythat those hosts can exchange more thankxsegments/sec, no matter howmuchbuffer space is available at each end.If the sender pushes too hard (i.e., sendsmore thankxsegments/sec), the network will become congested because it will beunable to deliversegments as fast as theyare coming in.What is needed is a mechanism that limits transmissions from the sender basedon the network’scarrying capacity rather than on the receiver’sbuffering capacity.Belsnes (1975) proposed using a sliding windowflow-control scheme in which thesender dynamically adjusts the windowsize to match the network’scarrying capac-ity.This means that a dynamic sliding windowcan implement both flowcontroland congestion control.If the network can handlecsegments/sec and the round-trip time (including transmission, propagation, queueing, processing at the re-ceiver, and return of the acknowledgement) isr,the sender’swindowshould becr.With a windowofthis size, the sender normally operates with the pipeline full.Anysmall decrease in network performance will cause it to block.Since the net-work capacity available to anygivenflowvaries overtime, the windowsize shouldbe adjusted frequently,totrack changes in the carrying capacity.Aswewill seelater,TCP uses a similar scheme.'),\n",

Thismodusoperandi is calledinverse multiplexing.Withknetwork connections open, the ef-fective bandwidth might be increased by a factor ofk.Anexample of inverse mul-tiplexing is SCTP which can run a connection using multiple network interfaces. Incontrast, TCP uses a single network endpoint.Inverse multiplexing is also foundat the link layer,when several low-rate links are used in parallel as one fast link.6.2.6 CrashRecoveryIf hosts and routers are subject to crashes or connections are long-lived(e.g.,large software or media downloads), recovery from these crashes becomes anissue.

Thetransport entities expect lost segmentsall the time and knowhow tocope with them by using retransmissions.Amore troublesome problem is howtorecoverfrom host crashes.In particu-lar,itmay be desirable for clients to be able to continue working when serverscrash and quickly reboot.To illustrate the difficulty,let us assume that one host,the client, is sending a long file to another host, the file server,using a simple stop-and-wait protocol.The transport layer on the server just passes the incoming seg-ments to the transport user,one by one.Partway through the transmission, the ser-vercrashes. Whenit comes back up, its tables are reinitialized, so it no longerknows precisely where it was.In an attempt to recoverits previous status, the server might send a broadcastsegment to all other hosts, announcing that it has just crashed and requesting thatits clients inform it of the status of all open connections.Each client can be in oneof twostates: one segment outstanding,S1,ornosegments outstanding,S0.Basedon only this state information, the client must decide whether to retransmit themost recent segment.At first glance, it would seem obvious: the client should retransmit if and onlyif it has an unacknowledged segment outstanding (i.e., is in stateS1)when it learnsof the crash.However, a closer inspection reveals difficulties with this naiveapproach. Consider,for example, the situation in which the server’stransport enti-ty first sends an acknowledgement and then, when the acknowledgement has beensent, writes to the application process.Writing a segment onto the output streamand sending an acknowledgement are twodistinct events that cannot be donesimultaneously.Ifacrash occurs after the acknowledgement has been sent but be-fore the write has been fully completed, the client will receive the acknowledge-ment and thus be in stateS0when the crash recovery announcement arrives. Theclient will therefore not retransmit, (incorrectly) thinking that the segment has arri-ved. Thisdecision by the client leads to a missing segment.At this point you may be thinking: ‘‘That problem can be solved easily.Allyou have todoisreprogram the transport entity to first do the write and then sendthe acknowledgement.’’ Try again. Imaginethat the write has been done but thecrash occurs before the acknowledgement can be sent.The client will be in stateS1and thus retransmit, leading to an undetected duplicate segment in the outputstream to the server application process.No matter howthe client and server are programmed, there are always situa-tions where the protocol fails to recoverproperly.The server can be programmedin one of twoways: acknowledge first or write first. Theclient can be pro-grammed in one of four ways: always retransmit the last segment, neverretransmitthe last segment, retransmit only in stateS0,orretransmit only in stateS1.Thisgiveseight combinations, but as we shall see, for each combination there is someset of events that makes the protocol fail.Three events are possible at the server: sending an acknowledgement (A), writ-ing to the output process (W), and crashing (C).

Controlling congestion to avoid this problem is thecombined responsibility of the network and transport layers. Congestion occurs atrouters, so it is detected at the network layer.However, congestion is ultimatelycaused by trafficsent into the network by the transport layer.The only effectivewaytocontrol congestion is for the transport protocols to send packets into the net-work more slowly.In Chap. 5, we studied congestion control mechanisms in the network layer.Inthis section, we will study the other half of the problem, congestion control mech-anisms in the transport layer.After describing the goals of congestion control, wewill describe howhosts can regulate the rate at which theysend packets into thenetwork. The Internet relies heavily on the transport layer for congestion control,and specific algorithms are built into TCP and other protocols.6.3.1 DesirableBandwidth AllocationBefore we describe howtoregulate traffic, we must understand what we aretrying to achieve byrunning a congestion control algorithm. That is, we must spec-ify the state in which a good congestion control algorithm will operate the network.The goal is more than to simply avoid congestion.It is to find a good allocation ofbandwidth to the transport entities that are using the network. A good allocationwill delivergood performance because it uses all the available bandwidth butavoids congestion, it will be fair across competing transport entities, and it willquickly track changes in trafficdemands. Wewill makeeach of these criteria moreprecise in turn.Efficiency and PowerAn efficient allocation of bandwidth across transport entities will use all of thenetwork capacity that is available. However, itisnot quite right to think that ifthere is a 100-Mbps link, fivetransport entities should get 20 Mbps each. Theyshould usually get less than 20 Mbps for good performance.

If the transport protocol is poorly designed andretransmits packets that have been delayed but not lost, the network can enter con-gestion collapse.In this state, senders are furiously sending packets, but increas-ingly little useful work is being accomplished.The corresponding delay is giveninFig. 6-19(b)Initially the delay is fixed,representing the propagation delay across the network. As the load approaches thecapacity,the delay rises, slowly at first and then much more rapidly.This is againbecause of bursts of trafficthat tend to mound up at high load.The delay cannotreally go to infinity,except in a model in which the routers have infinite buffers.Instead, packets will be lost after experiencing the maximum buffering delay.Forboth goodput and delay,performance begins to degrade at the onset of con-gestion. Intuitively,wewill obtain the best performance from the network if weallocate bandwidth up until the delay starts to climb rapidly.This point is belowthecapacity.Toidentify it, Kleinrock (1979) proposed the metric ofpower,wherepower= loaddelayPower will initially rise with offered load, as delay remains small and roughly con-stant, but will reach a maximum and fall as delay grows rapidly.The load with thehighest power represents an efficient load for the transport entity to place on thenetwork.

This sounds likeasimple question—give all thesenders an equal fraction of the bandwidth—but it is more complicated than that.Perhaps the first consideration is to ask what this problem has to do with con-gestion control. After all, if the network givesasender some amount of bandwidthto use, the sender should just use that much bandwidth. However, itisoften thecase that networks do not have a strict bandwidth reservation for each floworcon-nection. Theymay for some flows if quality of service is supported, but manycon-nections will seek to use whateverbandwidth is available or be lumped together bythe network under a common allocation. For example, IETF’sdifferentiated ser-vices separates trafficinto twoclasses and connections compete for bandwidthwithin each class. IP routers often have all connections competing for the samebandwidth. In this situation, it is the congestion control mechanism that is allocat-ing bandwidth to the competing connections.Asecond consideration is what a fair portion means for flows in a network. Itis simple enough ifNflows use a single link, in which case theycan all have 1/Nof the bandwidth (although efficiencywill dictate that theyuse slightly less if thetrafficisbursty). Butwhat happens if the flows have different, but overlapping,network paths? For example, one flowmay cross three links, and the other flowsmay cross one link. The three-link flowconsumes more network resources. Itmight be fairer in some sense to give itless bandwidth than the one-link flows. Itshould certainly be possible to support more one-link flows by reducing the band-width of the three-link flow. This point demonstrates an inherent tension betweenfairness and efficiency.However, wewill adopt a notion of fairness that does not depend on the lengthof the network path. Even with this simple model, giving connections an equalfraction of bandwidth is a bit complicated because different connections will takedifferent paths through the network and these paths will themselves have differentcapacities. In this case, it is possible for a flowtobebottlenecked on a downstreamlink and takeasmaller portion of an upstream link than other flows; reducing thebandwidth of the other flows would slowthem down but would not help the bottle-necked flowatall.The form of fairness that is often desired for network usage ismax-min fair-ness.Anallocation is max-min fair if the bandwidth giventoone flowcannot beincreased without decreasing the bandwidth giventoanother flowwith an alloca-tion that is no larger.That is, increasing the bandwidth of a flowwill only makethesituation worse for flows that are less well off.Let us see an example. A max-min fair allocation is shown for a network withfour flows,A,B,C,andD,inFig. 6-20.Each of the links between routers has thesame capacity,taken to be 1 unit, though in the general case the links will have dif-ferent capacities.

The remaining flow,A,competes withBon the link fromR2toR3.SinceBhas an allocation of 1/3,Agets the remaining 2/3 of the link. Notice that all of the other links have sparecapacity.However, this capacity cannot be giventoany ofthe flows withoutdecreasing the capacity of another,lower flow. For example, if more of the band-width on the link betweenR2andR3is giventoflowB,there will be less for flowA.This is reasonable as flowAalready has more bandwidth.However, the capac-ity of flowCorD(or both) must be decreased to give more bandwidth toB,andthese flows will have less bandwidth thanB.Thus, the allocation is max-min fair.\\n1/3R1 R2\\nDCBA\\n1/3\\n2/31/31/31/31/3 DCBA\\nR4\\nR3\\nR6R5\\n2/31/3\\nFigure6-20.Max-min bandwidth allocation for four flows.Max-min allocations can be computed givenaglobal knowledge of the net-work. An intuitive way to think about them is to imagine that the rate for all of theflows starts at zero and is slowly increased. When the rate reaches a bottleneck foranyflow, that flowstops increasing. The other flows continue to increase, sharingequally in the available capacity,until theytoo reach their respective bottlenecks.Athird consideration is the leveloverwhich to consider fairness. A networkcould be fair at the levelofconnections, connections between a pair of hosts, or allconnections per host.We examined this issue when we were discussing WFQ(Weighted Fair Queueing) in Sec. 5.4 and concluded that each of these definitionshas its problems. For example, defining fairness per host means that a busy serverwill fare no better than a mobile phone, while defining fairness per connectionencourages hosts to open more connections. Giventhat there is no clear answer,fairness is often considered per connection, but precise fairness is usually not aconcern. It is more important in practice that no connection be starved of band-width than that all connections get precisely the same amount of bandwidth. Infact, with TCP it is possible to open multiple connections and compete for band-width more aggressively.This tactic is used by bandwidth-hungry applicationssuch as BitTorrent for peer-to-peer file sharing.ConvergenceAfinal criterion is that the congestion control algorithm convergequickly to afair and efficient allocation of bandwidth.The discussion of the desirable operat-ing point above assumes a static network environment.

A good congestion control algorithm should rapidly convergetothe ideal operating point, and it should track that point as it changes overtime. Ifthe convergence is too slow, the algorithm will neverbeclose to the changing oper-ating point.If the algorithm is not stable, it may fail to convergetothe right pointin some cases, or evenoscillate around the right point.An example of a bandwidth allocation that changes overtime and convergesquickly is shown in Fig.6-21.

For example, Windows includes Compound TCP that uses bothpacket loss and delay as feedback signals (Tan et al., 2006).These designs aresummarized in Fig. 6-23.Protocol SignalExplicit?

For example, if XCP tells senders therate to use, the senders may simply use that rate. In the other cases, however, someguesswork is involved. In the absence of a congestion signal, the senders shouldincrease their rates. When a congestion signal is given, the senders should decreasetheir rates. The way in which the rates are increased or decreased is givenbyacontrol law.These laws have a major effect on performance.Chiu and Jain (1989) studied the case of binary congestion feedback and con-cluded thatAIMD(Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease)isthe appropriatecontrol lawtoarrive atthe efficient and fair operating point. Toargue this case,theyconstructed a graphical argument for the simple case of twoconnections com-peting for the bandwidth of a single link.

For example, the usersmay each increase their sending rate by 1 Mbps every second. Eventually,the oper-ating point crosses the efficiencyline and both users receive a congestion signalfrom the network. At this stage, theymust reduce their allocations. However, anadditive decrease would simply cause them to oscillate along an additive line. Thissituation is shown in Fig.6-24. Thebehavior will keep the operating point close toefficient, but it will not necessarily be fair.Similarly,consider the case when both users multiplicatively increase theirbandwidth overtime until theyreceive a congestion signal. For example, the usersmay increase their sending rate by 10% every second.If theythen multiplicativelydecrease their sending rates, the operating point of the users will simply oscillatealong a multiplicative line.

Itis not quite fair,since TCP connections adjust their windowsize byagivenamount every round-trip time. Different connections will have differentround-trip times. This leads to a bias in which connections to closer hosts receivemore bandwidth than connections to distant hosts, all else being equal.In Sec. 6.5, we will describe in detail howTCP implements an AIMD controllawtoadjust the sending rate and provide congestion control. This task is moredifficult than it sounds because rates are measured oversome interval and trafficisbursty.Instead of adjusting the rate directly,astrategy that is often used in practiceis to adjust the size of a sliding window. TCP uses this strategy.Ifthe windowsizeisWand the round-trip time isRTT,the equivalent rate isW/RTT.This strategy iseasy to combine with flowcontrol, which already uses a window, and has the ad-vantage that the sender paces packets using acknowledgements and hence slowsdown in oneRTTif it stops receiving reports that packets are leaving the network.As a final issue, there may be manydifferent transport protocols that send traf-ficinto the network. What will happen if the different protocols compete with dif-ferent control laws to avoid congestion?Unequal bandwidth allocations, that iswhat. Since TCP is the dominant form of congestion control in the Internet, thereis significant community pressure for newtransport protocols to be designed sothat theycompete fairly with it. The early streaming media protocols caused prob-lems by excessively reducing TCP throughput because theydid not compete fairly.This led to the notion ofTCP-friendlycongestion control in which TCP and non-TCP transport protocols can be freely mixed with no ill effects (Floyd et al., 2000).6.3.3 Wireless IssuesTransport protocols such as TCP that implement congestion control should beindependent of the underlying network and link layer technologies. That is a goodtheory,but in practice there are issues with wireless networks. The main issue isthat packet loss is often used as a congestion signal, including by TCP as we have'),\n",

Theyjust are not as reliable as wired networks.With the AIMD control law, high throughput requires very small levels ofpacket loss. Analyses by Padhye et al. (1998) showthat the throughput goes up asthe inverse square root of the packet loss rate. What this means in practice is thatthe loss rate for fast TCP connections is very small; 1% is a moderate loss rate, andby the time the loss rate reaches 10% the connection has effectively stopped work-ing. However, for wireless networks such as 802.11 LANs, frame loss rates of atleast 10% are common.This difference means that, absent protective measures,congestion control schemes that use packet loss as a signal will unnecessarilythrottle connections that run overwireless links to very lowrates.To function well, the only packet losses that the congestion control algorithmshould observeare losses due to insufficient bandwidth, not losses due to transmis-sion errors. One solution to this problem is to mask the wireless losses by using re-transmissions overthe wireless link. For example, 802.11 uses a stop-and-wait pro-tocol to delivereach frame, retrying transmissions multiple times if need be beforereporting a packet loss to the higher layer.Inthe normal case, each packet is deliv-ered despite transient transmission errors that are not visible to the higher layers.Fig. 6-26shows a path with a wired and wireless link for which the maskingstrategy is used. There are twoaspects to note.First, the sender does not necessar-ily knowthat the path includes a wireless link, since all it sees is the wired link towhich it is attached. Internet paths are heterogeneous and there is no general meth-od for the sender to tell what kind of links comprise the path.This complicates thecongestion control problem, as there is no easy way to use one protocol for wire-less links and another protocol for wired links.\\nWired link\\nSender Receiver\\nTransport with end-to-end congestion control (loss = congestion)\\nLink layer retransmission(loss = transmission error)\\nWireless link \\nFigure6-26.Congestion control overapath with a wireless link.The second aspect is a puzzle.The figure shows twomechanisms that are dri-venbyloss: link layer frame retransmissions, and transport layer congestion con-trol. The puzzle is howthese twomechanisms can co-exist without getting con-fused. After all, a loss should cause only one mechanism to takeaction because itis either a transmission error or a congestion signal.It cannot be both. If both'),\n",

Loss timers in transport protocols fire on the order ofmilliseconds to seconds.The difference is three orders of magnitude. This allowswireless links to detect frame losses and retransmit frames to repair transmissionerrors long before packet loss is inferred by the transport entity.The masking strategy is sufficient to let most transport protocols run wellacross most wireless links. However, itisnot always a fitting solution. Some wire-less links have long round-trip times, such as satellites. For these links other tech-niques must be used to mask loss, such as FEC (Forward Error Correction), or thetransport protocol must use a non-loss signal for congestion control.Asecond issue with congestion control overwireless links is variable capacity.That is, the capacity of a wireless link changes overtime, sometimes abruptly,asnodes move and the signal-to-noise ratio varies with the changing channel condi-tions. Thisis unlikewired links whose capacity is fixed. The transport protocolmust adapt to the changing capacity of wireless links, otherwise it will either con-gest the network or fail to use the available capacity.One possible solution to this problem is simply not to worry about it. Thisstrategy is feasible because congestion control algorithms must already handle thecase of newusers entering the network or existing users changing their sendingrates. Even though the capacity of wired links is fixed, the changing behavior ofother users presents itself as variability in the bandwidth that is available to a givenuser.Thus it is possible to simply run TCP overapath with an 802.11 wireless linkand obtain reasonable performance.However, when there is much wireless variability,transport protocols designedfor wired links may have trouble keeping up and deliverpoor performance. Thesolution in this case is a transport protocol that is designed for wireless links.Aparticularly challenging setting is a wireless mesh network in which multiple,interfering wireless links must be crossed, routes change due to mobility,and thereis lots of loss.Research in this area is ongoing. See Li et al. (2009) for an exampleof wireless transport protocol design.6.4 THEINTERNET TRANSPORTPROTOCOLS: UDPThe Internet has twomain protocols in the transport layer,aconnectionlessprotocol and a connection-oriented one.The protocols complement each other.The connectionless protocol is UDP.Itdoes almost nothing beyond sending pack-ets between applications, letting applications build their own protocols on top as'),\n",

Notonly is the code simple, butfewer messages are required (one in each direction) than with a protocol requiringan initial setup likeTCP.An application that uses UDP this way is DNS (Domain Name System), whichwe will study in Chap. 7.In brief, a program that needs to look up the IP addressof some host name, for example,www.cs.berkeley.edu,can send a UDP packet con-taining the host name to a DNS server.The server replies with a UDP packet con-taining the host’sIPaddress. Nosetup is needed in advance and no release isneeded afterward. Justtwomessages go overthe network.6.4.2 RemoteProcedureCallIn a certain sense, sending a message to a remote host and getting a reply backis a lot likemaking a function call in a programming language.In both cases, youstart with one or more parameters and you get back a result.This observation hasled people to try to arrange request-reply interactions on networks to be cast in theform of procedure calls.Such an arrangement makes network applications mucheasier to program and more familiar to deal with.Forexample, just imagine a pro-cedure namedgetIPaddress(hostname)that works by sending a UDP packetto a DNS server and waiting for the reply,timing out and trying again if one is notforthcoming quickly enough.In this way,all the details of networking can be hid-den from the programmer.The key work in this area was done by Birrell and Nelson (1984).In a nut-shell, what Birrell and Nelson suggested was allowing programs to call procedureslocated on remote hosts.When a process on machine 1 calls a procedure on ma-chine 2, the calling process on 1 is suspended and execution of the called proce-dure takes place on 2.Information can be transported from the caller to the calleein the parameters and can come back in the procedure result.No message passingis visible to the application programmer.This technique is known asRPC(Remote ProcedureCall)and has become the basis for manynetworking applica-tions. Traditionally,the calling procedure is known as the client and the called pro-cedure is known as the server,and we will use those names here too.The idea behind RPC is to makearemote procedure call look as much as pos-sible likealocal one.In the simplest form, to call a remote procedure, the clientprogram must be bound with a small library procedure, called theclient stub,thatrepresents the server procedure in the client’saddress space.Similarly,the serveris bound with a procedure called theserverstub.These procedures hide the factthat the procedure call from the client to the server is not local.The actual steps in making an RPC are shown in Fig.6-29. Step1isthe clientcalling the client stub.This call is a local procedure call, with the parameterspushed onto the stack in the normal way.Step 2 is the client stub packing the pa-rameters into a message and making a system call to send the message.Packingthe parameters is calledmarshaling.Step 3 is the operating system sending the'),\n",

The stubs are shaded.The key item to note here is that the client procedure, written by the user,justmakes a normal (i.e., local) procedure call to the client stub, which has the samename as the server procedure.Since the client procedure and client stub are in thesame address space, the parameters are passed in the usual way.Similarly,the ser-verprocedure is called by a procedure in its address space with the parameters itexpects. Tothe server procedure, nothing is unusual.In this way,instead of I/Obeing done on sockets, network communication is done by faking a normal proce-dure call.Despite the conceptual elegance of RPC, there are a fewsnakes hiding underthe grass.Abig one is the use of pointer parameters.Normally,passing a pointerto a procedure is not a problem.The called procedure can use the pointer in thesame way the caller can because both procedures live inthe same virtual addressspace. With RPC, passing pointers is impossible because the client and server arein different address spaces.In some cases, tricks can be used to makeitpossible to pass pointers.Supposethat the first parameter is a pointer to an integer,k.The client stub can marshalkand send it along to the server.The server stub then creates a pointer tokandpasses it to the server procedure, just as it expects. Whenthe server procedure re-turns control to the server stub, the latter sendskback to the client, where the newkis copied overthe old one, just in case the server changed it.In effect, the stan-dard calling sequence of call-by-reference has been replaced by call-by-copy-re-store. Unfortunately,this trick does not always work, for example, if the pointerpoints to a graph or other complexdata structure.Forthis reason, some restric-tions must be placed on parameters to procedures called remotely,asweshall see.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 574}, page_content='SEC. 6.4 THE INTERNET TRANSPORTPROTOCOLS: UDP 551Asecond problem is that in weakly typed languages, likeC,itisperfectly legalto write a procedure that computes the inner product of twovectors (arrays), with-out specifying howlarge either one is.Each could be terminated by a special valueknown only to the calling and called procedures.Under these circumstances, it isessentially impossible for the client stub to marshal the parameters: it has no wayof determining howlarge theyare.Athird problem is that it is not always possible to deduce the types of theparameters, not evenfrom a formal specification or the code itself.An example isprintf,which may have any number of parameters (at least one), and the parame-ters can be an arbitrary mixture of integers, shorts, longs, characters, strings, float-ing-point numbers of various lengths, and other types.Trying to callprintfas aremote procedure would be practically impossible because C is so permissive.However, a rule saying that RPC can be used provided that you do not program inC(or C++) would not be popular with a lot of programmers.Afourth problem relates to the use of global variables. Normally,the callingand called procedure can communicate by using global variables (although it is notgood practice), in addition to communicating via parameters.But if the called pro-cedure is movedtoaremote machine, the code will fail because the global vari-ables are no longer shared.These problems are not meant to suggest that RPC is hopeless.In fact, it iswidely used, but some restrictions are needed to makeitwork well in practice.In terms of transport layer protocols, UDP is a good base on which to imple-ment RPC. Both requests and replies may be sent as a single UDP packet in thesimplest case and the operation can be fast. However, animplementation mustinclude other machinery as well.Because the request or the reply may be lost, theclient must keep a timer to retransmit the request.Note that a reply serves as animplicit acknowledgement for a request, so the request need not be separately ac-knowledged. Sometimesthe parameters or results may be larger than the maxi-mum UDP packet size, in which case some protocol is needed to deliverlarge mes-sages in pieces and reassemble them correctly.Ifmultiple requests and replies canoverlap (as in the case of concurrent programming), an identifier is needed tomatch the request with the reply.Ahigher-levelconcern is that the operation may not be idempotent (i.e., safe torepeat). The simple case is idempotent operations such as DNS requests andreplies. Theclient can safely retransmit these requests again and again if noreplies are forthcoming. It does not matter whether the server neverreceivedthe re-quest, or it was the reply that was lost. The answer,when it finally arrives, will bethe same (assuming the DNS database is not updated in the meantime).However,not all operations are idempotent, for example, because theyhaveimportant sideeffects such as incrementing a counter.RPC for these operations requires strongersemantics so that when the programmer calls a procedure it is not executed multi-ple times. In this case, it may be necessary to set up a TCP connection and send therequest overitrather than using UDP.'),\n",

Itis described in RFC3550 and is nowinwidespread use for multimedia applications.We will describetwoaspects of real-time transport. The first is the RTP protocol for transportingaudio and video data in packets. The second is the processing that takes place,mostly at the receiver, toplay out the audio and video at the right time.Thesefunctions fit into the protocol stack as shown in Fig. 6-30.Multimedia applicationRTPSocket interfaceUDPIPEthernet(a) (b)\\nEthernetheaderIPheaderUDPheaderRTPheaderRTP payloadUDP payloadIP payloadEthernet payload\\nUserspaceOSKernel\\nFigure6-30.(a) The position of RTP in the protocol stack. (b) Packet nesting.RTPnormally runs in user space overUDP (in the operating system).It oper-ates as follows. Themultimedia application consists of multiple audio, video, text,and possibly other streams.These are fed into the RTP library,which is in userspace along with the application.This library multiplexesthe streams and encodesthem in RTP packets, which it stuffs into a socket. Onthe operating system side ofthe socket, UDP packets are generated to wrap the RTP packets and handed to IPfor transmission overalink such as Ethernet.The reverse process happens at thereceiver. The multimedia application eventually receivesmultimedia data from theRTPlibrary.Itisresponsible for playing out the media.The protocol stack for thissituation is shown in Fig. 6-30(a).The packet nesting is shown in Fig. 6-30(b).As a consequence of this design, it is a little hard to say which layer RTP is in.Since it runs in user space and is linked to the application program, it certainlylooks likeanapplication protocol.On the other hand, it is a generic, applica-tion-independent protocol that just provides transport facilities, so it also looks like'),\n",

TheUDP stream can be sent to a single destination(unicasting) or to multiple destinations (multicasting).Because RTP just uses nor-mal UDP,its packets are not treated specially by the routers unless some normal IPquality-of-service features are enabled.In particular,there are no special guaran-tees about delivery,and packets may be lost, delayed, corrupted, etc.The RTP format contains several features to help receivers work with multi-media information.Each packet sent in an RTP stream is givenanumber onehigher than its predecessor.This numbering allows the destination to determine ifanypackets are missing.If a packet is missing, the best action for the destinationto takeisuptothe application. It may be to skip a video frame if the packets arecarrying video data, or to approximate the missing value by interpolation if thepackets are carrying audio data.Retransmission is not a practical option since theretransmitted packet would probably arrive too late to be useful.As a conse-quence, RTP has no acknowledgements, and no mechanism to request retransmis-sions.Each RTP payload may contain multiple samples, and theymay be coded anywaythat the application wants. Toallowfor interworking, RTP defines severalprofiles (e.g., a single audio stream), and for each profile, multiple encoding for-mats may be allowed. For example, a single audio stream may be encoded as 8-bitPCM samples at 8 kHz using delta encoding, predictive encoding, GSM encoding,MP3 encoding, and so on.RTPprovides a header field in which the source canspecify the encoding but is otherwise not involved in howencoding is done.Another facility manyreal-time applications need is timestamping.The ideahere is to allowthe source to associate a timestamp with the first sample in eachpacket. Thetimestamps are relative tothe start of the stream, so only the dif-ferences between timestamps are significant. Theabsolute values have nomean-ing. Aswe will describe shortly,this mechanism allows the destination to do asmall amount of buffering and play each sample the right number of millisecondsafter the start of the stream, independently of when the packet containing the sam-ple arrived.Not only does timestamping reduce the effects of variation in network delay,butitalso allows multiple streams to be synchronized with each other.For ex-ample, a digital television program might have a video stream and twoaudiostreams. Thetwoaudio streams could be for stereo broadcasts or for handlingfilms with an original language soundtrack and a soundtrack dubbed into the locallanguage, giving the viewer a choice.Each stream comes from a different physical'),\n",

Itconsists of three 32-bit words andpotentially some extensions. Thefirst word contains theVersionfield, which is al-ready at 2.Let us hope this version is very close to the ultimate version since thereis only one code point left (although 3 could be defined as meaning that the realversion was in an extension word).32 bitsVer.PX MPayload typeSequence numberTimestampSynchronization source identifier\\nContributing source identifier\\nCC\\nFigure6-31.The RTP header.ThePbit indicates that the packet has been padded to a multiple of 4 bytes.The last padding byte tells howmanybytes were added.TheXbit indicates that anextension header is present.The format and meaning of the extension header arenot defined.

Finally,theContributing source identifiers,ifany,are used when mixers are present in the studio.In that case, the mixer is the syn-chronizing source, and the streams being mixed are listed here.RTCP—The Real-time Transport Control ProtocolRTPhas a little sister protocol (little sibling protocol?) calledRTCP(Real-time Transport Control Protocol). Itis defined along with RTP in RFC 3550 andhandles feedback, synchronization, and the user interface. It does not transport anymedia samples.The first function can be used to provide feedback on delay,variation in delayor jitter,bandwidth, congestion, and other network properties to the sources.Thisinformation can be used by the encoding process to increase the data rate (and givebetter quality) when the network is functioning well and to cut back the data ratewhen there is trouble in the network. Byproviding continuous feedback, theencoding algorithms can be continuously adapted to provide the best quality pos-sible under the current circumstances.Forexample, if the bandwidth increases ordecreases during the transmission, the encoding may switch from MP3 to 8-bitPCM to delta encoding as required.ThePayload typefield is used to tell the desti-nation what encoding algorithm is used for the current packet, making it possibleto vary it on demand.An issue with providing feedback is that the RTCP reports are sent to all par-ticipants. For a multicast application with a large group, the bandwidth used byRTCP would quickly growlarge. Toprevent this from happening, RTCP sendersscale down the rate of their reports to collectively consume no more than, say,5%of the media bandwidth. Todothis, each participant needs to knowthe mediabandwidth, which it learns from the sender,and the number of participants, whichit estimates by listening to other RTCP reports.RTCP also handles interstream synchronization.The problem is that differentstreams may use different clocks, with different granularities and different driftrates. RTCP can be used to keep them in sync.Finally,RTCP provides a way for naming the various sources (e.g., in ASCIItext). Thisinformation can be displayed on the receiver’sscreen to indicate who istalking at the moment.More information about RTP can be found in Perkins (2003).Playout with Buffering and Jitter ControlOnce the media information reaches the receiver, itmust be played out at theright time. In general, this will not be the time at which the RTP packet arrivedatthe receiverbecause packets will takeslightly different amounts of time to transitthe network.

Packet 2 undergoesmore delay and takes 2 sec to arrive.Asthe packets arrive,theyare buffered onthe client machine.\\n0 5 1234567810Time (sec)\\nTime in buffer1520Gap in playback1Packet removed from bufferPacket arrives at buffer23456 7 812345678Packet departs source\\nFigure6-32.Smoothing the output stream by buffering packets.Att= 10 sec, playback begins. Atthis time, packets 1 through 6 have beenbuffered so that theycan be removedfrom the buffer at uniform intervals forsmooth play.Inthe general case, it is not necessary to use uniform intervalsbecause the RTP timestamps tell when the media should be played.Unfortunately,wecan see that packet 8 has been delayed so much that it is notavailable when its play slot comes up. There are twooptions. Packet 8 can beskipped and the player can move ontosubsequent packets. Alternatively,playbackcan stop until packet 8 arrives, creating an annoying gap in the music or movie. Inalivemedia application likeavoice-over-IP call, the packet will typically beskipped. Live applications do not work well on hold. In a streaming media applica-tion, the player might pause.This problem can be alleviated by delaying the start-ing time evenmore, by using a larger buffer.For a streaming audio or videoplayer,buffers of about 10 seconds are often used to ensure that the player receivesall of the packets (that are not dropped in the network) in time.Forliveapplica-tions likevideoconferencing, short buffers are needed for responsiveness.Akey consideration for smooth playout is theplayback point,orhow long towait at the receiverfor media before playing it out.Deciding howlong to wait de-pends on the jitter.The difference between a low-jitter and high-jitter connectionis shown in Fig.6-33. Theaverage delay may not differ greatly between the two,butifthere is high jitter the playback point may need to be much further out tocapture 99% of the packets than if there is lowjitter.'),\n",

Each dif-ference givesasample of the delay (plus an arbitrary,fixed offset). However, thedelay can change overtime due to other,competing trafficand changing routes.Toaccommodate this change, applications can adapt their playback point while theyare running. However, ifnot done well, changing the playback point can producean observable glitch to the user.One way to avoid this problem for audio is toadapt the playback point betweentalkspurts,inthe gaps in a conversation. No onewill notice the difference between a short and slightly longer silence.RTPletsapplications set theMmarker bit to indicate the start of a newtalkspurt for thispurpose.If the absolute delay until media is played out is too long, live applications willsuffer.Nothing can be done to reduce the propagation delay if a direct path isalready being used. The playback point can be pulled in by simply accepting that alarger fraction of packets will arrive too late to be played. If this is not acceptable,the only way to pull in the playback point is to reduce the jitter by using a betterquality of service, for example, the expedited forwarding differentiated service.That is, a better network is needed.6.5 THEINTERNET TRANSPORTPROTOCOLS: TCPUDP is a simple protocol and it has some very important uses, such as cli-ent-server interactions and multimedia, but for most Internet applications, reliable,sequenced delivery is needed, so UDP will not do.UDP cannot provide this, soanother protocol is required.It is called TCP and is the main workhorse of theInternet.

Aninternetworkdiffers from a single network because different parts may have wildly differenttopologies, bandwidths, delays, packet sizes, and other parameters.TCP wasdesigned to dynamically adapt to properties of the internetwork and to be robust inthe face of manykinds of failures.TCP was formally defined in RFC 793 in September 1981.As time went on,manyimprovements have been made, and various errors and inconsistencies havebeen fixed. Togiveyou a sense of the extent of TCP,the important RFCs are nowRFC 793 plus: clarifications and bug fixes in RFC 1122; extensions for high-per-formance in RFC 1323; selective acknowledgements in RFC 2018; congestion con-trol in RFC 2581; repurposing of header fields for quality of service in RFC 2873;improvedretransmission timers in RFC 2988; and explicit congestion notificationin RFC 3168.The full collection is evenlarger,which led to a guide to the manyRFCs, published of course as another RFC document, RFC 4614.Each machine supporting TCP has a TCP transport entity,either a library pro-cedure, a user process, or most commonly part of the kernel. Inall cases, it man-ages TCP streams and interfaces to the IP layer.ATCP entity accepts user datastreams from local processes, breaks them up into pieces not exceeding 64 KB (inpractice, often 1460 data bytes in order to fit in a single Ethernet frame with the IPand TCP headers), and sends each piece as a separate IP datagram.When data-grams containing TCP data arrive atamachine, theyare giventothe TCP entity,which reconstructs the original byte streams.Forsimplicity,wewill sometimesuse just ‘‘TCP’’tomean the TCP transport entity (a piece of software) or the TCPprotocol (a set of rules).From the context it will be clear which is meant.Forexample, in ‘‘The user givesTCP the data,’’ the TCP transport entity is clearly in-tended.The IP layer givesnoguarantee that datagrams will be delivered properly,noranyindication of howfast datagrams may be sent.It is up to TCP to send data-grams fast enough to makeuse of the capacity but not cause congestion, and totime out and retransmit anydatagrams that are not delivered. Datagramsthat doarrive may well do so in the wrong order; it is also up to TCP to reassemble theminto messages in the proper sequence.In short, TCP must furnish good per-formance with the reliability that most applications want and that IP does not pro-vide.6.5.2 TheTCP Service ModelTCP service is obtained by both the sender and the receivercreating endpoints, calledsockets,asdiscussed in Sec.6.1.3.

The original intent was to let applications tell TCP implementa-tions via the PUSH flag not to delay the transmission.However, applications can-not literally set the PUSH flag themselves when theysend data. Instead, differentoperating systems have evolved different options to expedite transmission (e.g.,TCPNODELAYinWindows and Linux).ForInternet archaeologists, we will also mention one interesting feature ofTCP service that remains in the protocol but is rarely used:urgent data.When anapplication has high-priority data that should be processed immediately,for ex-ample, if an interactive user hits the CTRL-C key tobreak offaremote computa-tion that has already begun, the sending application can put some control infor-mation in the data stream and give ittoTCP along with the URGENT flag.Thisevent causes TCP to stop accumulating data and transmit everything it has for thatconnection immediately,with no delay.'),\n",

The start of the urgent data isnot marked. Itis up to the application to figure that out.This scheme provides a crude signaling mechanism and leaveseverything elseup to the application. However, while urgent data is potentially useful, it found nocompelling application early on and fell into disuse. Its use is nowdiscouraged be-cause of implementation differences, leaving applications to handle their own sig-naling. Perhapsfuture transport protocols will provide better signaling.6.5.3 TheTCP ProtocolIn this section, we will give a general overviewofthe TCP protocol.In thenext one, we will go overthe protocol header,field by field.Akey feature of TCP,and one that dominates the protocol design, is that everybyte on a TCP connection has its own 32-bit sequence number.When the Internetbegan, the lines between routers were mostly 56-kbps leased lines, so a host blast-ing awayatfull speed took over1week to cycle through the sequence numbers.At modern network speeds, the sequence numbers can be consumed at an alarmingrate, as we will see later.Separate 32-bit sequence numbers are carried on packetsfor the sliding windowposition in one direction and for acknowledgements in thereverse direction, as discussed below.The sending and receiving TCP entities exchange data in the form of segments.ATCP segmentconsists of a fixed 20-byte header (plus an optional part) followedby zero or more data bytes.The TCP software decides howbig segments shouldbe. Itcan accumulate data from several writes into one segment or can split datafrom one write overmultiple segments. Two limits restrict the segment size.First,each segment, including the TCP header,must fit in the 65,515-byte IP payload.Second, each link has anMTU(Maximum Transfer Unit). Eachsegment mustfitinthe MTU at the sender and receiversothat it can be sent and receivedinasingle, unfragmented packet. Inpractice, the MTU is generally 1500 bytes (theEthernet payload size) and thus defines the upper bound on segment size.However, itisstill possible for IP packets carrying TCP segments to be frag-mented when passing overanetwork path for which some link has a small MTU.If this happens, it degrades performance and causes other problems (Kent andMogul, 1987).Instead, modern TCP implementations performpath MTU discov-eryby using the technique outlined in RFC 1191 .We describedit inSec. 5.5.6.This technique uses ICMP error messages to find the smallest MTU for anylink onthe path. TCP then adjusts the segment size downwards to avoid fragmentation.The basic protocol used by TCP entities is the sliding windowprotocol with adynamic windowsize. Whenasender transmits a segment, it also starts a timer.When the segment arrivesatthe destination, the receiving TCP entity sends back a'),\n",

Ifthe sender’stimer goes offbefore the acknowledgementis received, the sender transmits the segment again.Although this protocol sounds simple, there are manysometimes subtle ins andouts, which we will coverbelow. Segments can arrive out of order,sobytes3072–4095 can arrive but cannot be acknowledged because bytes 2048–3071 havenot turned up yet.Segments can also be delayed so long in transit that the sendertimes out and retransmits them.The retransmissions may include different byteranges than the original transmission, requiring careful administration to keep trackof which bytes have been correctly receivedsofar.However, since each byte inthe stream has its own unique offset, it can be done.TCP must be prepared to deal with these problems and solvethem in anefficient way.Aconsiderable amount of effort has gone into optimizing the per-formance of TCP streams, eveninthe face of network problems.Anumber of thealgorithms used by manyTCP implementations will be discussed below.6.5.4 TheTCP Segment HeaderFigure 6-36 shows the layout of a TCP segment. Every segment begins with afixed-format, 20-byte header.The fixed header may be followed by header op-tions. Afterthe options, if any, upto65, 535< 20< 20= 65, 495data bytes mayfollow, where the first 20 refer to the IP header and the second to the TCP header.Segments without anydata are legaland are commonly used for acknowledge-ments and control messages.Let us dissect the TCP header field by field. TheSource portandDestinationportfields identify the local end points of the connection.ATCP port plus itshost’sIPaddress forms a 48-bit unique end point.The source and destination endpoints together identify the connection.This connection identifier is called a5tuplebecause it consists of fivepieces of information: the protocol (TCP), sourceIP and source port, and destination IP and destination port.TheSequence numberandAcknowledgement numberfields perform theirusual functions.Note that the latter specifies the next in-order byte expected, notthe last byte correctly received. Itis acumulative acknowledgementbecause itsummarizes the receiveddata with a single number.Itdoes not go beyond lostdata. Bothare 32 bits because every byte of data is numbered in a TCP stream.TheTCP header lengthtells howmany32-bit words are contained in the TCPheader.This information is needed because theOptionsfield is of variable length,so the header is, too.Technically,this field really indicates the start of the datawithin the segment, measured in 32-bit words, but that number is just the headerlength in words, so the effect is the same.Next comes a 4-bit field that is not used.The fact that these bits haveremained unused for 30 years (as only 2 of the original reserved 6 bits have been'),\n",

IfACKis 0, the segment does not contain anacknowledgement, so theAcknowledgement numberfield is ignored.ThePSHbit indicates PUSHed data.The receiverishereby kindly requestedto deliverthe data to the application upon arrivaland not buffer it until a full bufferhas been received(which it might otherwise do for efficiency).TheRSTbit is used to abruptly reset a connection that has become confuseddue to a host crash or for some other reason.It is also used to reject an invalid'),\n",

Inessence, theSYNbit is used to denote bothCONNEC-TION REQUESTandCONNECTION ACCEPTED,with theACKbit used to distin-guish between those twopossibilities.TheFINbit is used to release a connection.It specifies that the sender has nomore data totransmit.However, after closing a connection, the closing processmay continue toreceivedata indefinitely.BothSYNandFINsegments havesequence numbers and are thus guaranteed to be processed in the correct order.Flowcontrol in TCP is handled using a variable-sized sliding window. TheWindow sizefield tells howmanybytes may be sent starting at the byte acknow-ledged. AWindow sizefield of 0 is legaland says that the bytes up to and includ-ingAcknowledgement number< 1havebeen received, but that the receiverhasnot had a chance to consume the data and would likenomore data for the moment,thank you.The receivercan later grant permission to send by transmitting a seg-ment with the sameAcknowledgement numberand a nonzeroWindow sizefield.In the protocols of Chap. 3, acknowledgements of frames receivedand permis-sion to send newframes were tied together.This was a consequence of a fixedwindowsize for each protocol.In TCP,acknowledgements and permission to sendadditional data are completely decoupled.In effect, a receivercan say: ‘‘I have re-ceivedbytes up throughkbutIdonot want anymore just now, thank you.’’ Thisdecoupling (in fact, a variable-sized window) givesadditional flexibility.Wewillstudy it in detail below.AChecksumis also provided for extra reliability.Itchecksums the header,thedata, and a conceptual pseudoheader in exactly the same way as UDP,except thatthe pseudoheader has the protocol number for TCP (6) and the checksum ismandatory.Please see Sec. 6.4.1 for details.TheOptionsfield provides a way to add extra facilities not covered by the reg-ular header.Manyoptions have been defined and several are commonly used.Theoptions are of variable length, fill a multiple of 32 bits by using padding withzeros, and may extend to 40 bytes to accommodate the longest TCP header thatcan be specified. Some options are carried when a connection is established tonegotiate or inform the other side of capabilities. Other options are carried onpackets during the lifetime of the connection.Each option has a Type-Length-Value encoding.Awidely used option is the one that allows each host to specify theMSS(Maximum Segment Size)itiswilling to accept.Using large segments is moreefficient than using small ones because the 20-byte header can be amortized overmore data, but small hosts may not be able to handle big segments. Duringcon-nection setup, each side can announce its maximum and see its partner’s. Ifahost'),\n",

Ifthe round-trip propagation delay is 50 msec (which is typical for a transcontinental fiber), thesender will be idle more than 98% of the time waiting for acknowledgements. Alarger windowsize would allowthe sender to keep pumping data out.Thewindowscaleoption allows the sender and receivertonegotiate a windowscale factor atthe start of a connection.Both sides use the scale factor to shift theWindow sizefield up to 14 bits to the left, thus allowing windows of up to 230bytes. MostTCPimplementations support this option.Thetimestampoption carries a timestamp sent by the sender and echoed bythe receiver. Itisincluded in every packet, once its use is established during con-nection setup, and used to compute round-trip time samples that are used to esti-mate when a packet has been lost. It is also used as a logical extension of the 32-bitsequence number.Onafast connection, the sequence number may wrap aroundquickly,leading to possible confusion between old and newdata. The PAWSscheme described earlier discards arriving segments with old timestamps to preventthis problem.Finally,theSACK(Selective ACKnowledgement)option lets a receivertell asender the ranges of sequence numbers that it has received. It supplements theAc-knowledgement numberand is used after a packet has been lost but subsequent (orduplicate) data has arrived. Thenewdata is not reflected by theAcknowledgementnumberfield in the header because that field givesonly the next in-order byte thatis expected. With SACK, the sender is explicitly aware of what data the receiverhas and hence can determine what data should be retransmitted.SACK is definedin RFC 2108 and RFC 2883 and is increasingly used.We describe the use ofSACK along with congestion control in Sec. 6.5.10.6.5.5 TCPConnection EstablishmentConnections are established in TCP by means of the three-way handshakedis-cussed in Sec.6.2.2. Toestablish a connection, one side, say,the server,passivelywaits for an incoming connection by executing theLISTENandACCEPTprimitivesin that order,either specifying a specific source or nobody in particular.The other side, say,the client, executes aCONNECTprimitive,specifying the IPaddress and port to which it wants to connect, the maximum TCP segment size it iswilling to accept, and optionally some user data (e.g., a password). TheCONNECTprimitive sends a TCP segment with theSYNbit on andACKbit offand waits for aresponse from the other end.'),\n",

Itcan either accept or reject the connection.If it accepts, an acknowl-edgement segment is sent back.The sequence of TCP segments sent in the normalcase is shown in Fig.6-37(a). Notethat aSYNsegment consumes 1 byte ofsequence space so that it can be acknowledged unambiguously.In the event that twohosts simultaneously attempt to establish a connectionbetween the same twosockets, the sequence of events is as illustrated inFig. 6-37(b).The result of these events is that just one connection is established,not two, because connections are identified by their end points.If the first setupresults in a connection identified by (x,y)and the second one does too, only one ta-ble entry is made, namely,for (x,y).Recall that the initial sequence number chosen by each host should cycleslowly,rather than be a constant such as 0. This rule is to protect against delayedduplicate packets, as we discussed in Sec 6.2.2.Originally,this was accomplishedwith a clock-based scheme in which the clock ticked every 4µ sec.However, a vulnerability with implementing the three-way handshakeisthatthe listening process must remember its sequence number as soon it responds withits ownSYNsegment. Thismeans that a malicious sender can tie up resources on ahost by sending a stream ofSYNsegments and neverfollowing through to com-plete the connection.This attack is called aSYN flood,and it crippled manyWebservers in the 1990s.Nowways are known for defending against this attack.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 590}, page_content='SEC. 6.5 THE INTERNET TRANSPORTPROTOCOLS: TCP 567One way to defend against this attack is to useSYN cookies.Instead ofremembering the sequence number,ahost chooses a cryptographically generatedsequence number,puts it on the outgoing segment, and forgets it.If the three-wayhandshakecompletes, this sequence number (plus 1) will be returned to the host.Itcan then regenerate the correct sequence number by running the same crypto-graphic function, as long as the inputs to that function are known, for example, theother host’sIPaddress and port, and a local secret. This procedure allows the hostto check that an acknowledged sequence number is correct without having toremember the sequence number separately.There are some caveats, such as theinability to handle TCP options, so SYN cookies may be used only when the hostis subject to a SYN flood. However, theyare an interesting twist on connectionestablishment. For more information, see RFC 4987 and Lemon (2002).6.5.6 TCPConnection ReleaseAlthough TCP connections are full duplex, to understand howconnections arereleased it is best to think of them as a pair of simplexconnections. Eachsimplexconnection is released independently of its sibling.To release a connection, eitherparty can send a TCP segment with theFINbit set, which means that it has nomore data to transmit.When theFINis acknowledged, that direction is shut downfor newdata. Datamay continue to flowindefinitely in the other direction, howev-er.When both directions have been shut down, the connection is released.Nor-mally,four TCP segments are needed to release a connection: oneFINand oneACKfor each direction.However, itispossible for the firstACKand the secondFINto be contained in the same segment, reducing the total count to three.Just as with telephone calls in which both people say goodbye and hang up thephone simultaneously,both ends of a TCP connection may sendFINsegments atthe same time.These are each acknowledged in the usual way,and the connectionis shut down. Thereis, in fact, no essential difference between the twohostsreleasing sequentially or simultaneously.To avoid the two-army problem (discussed in Sec. 6.2.3), timers are used.If aresponse to aFINis not forthcoming within twomaximum packet lifetimes, thesender of theFINreleases the connection.The other side will eventually noticethat nobody seems to be listening to it anymore and will time out as well.Whilethis solution is not perfect, giventhe fact that a perfect solution is theoreticallyimpossible, it will have todo. Inpractice, problems rarely arise.6.5.7 TCPConnection Management ModelingThe steps required to establish and release connections can be represented in afinite state machine with the 11 states listed in Fig.6-38.

Thecommon case of aclient actively connecting to a passive server is shown with heavy lines—solid forthe client, dotted for the server.The lightface lines are unusual event sequences.Each line in Fig.6-39 is marked by anevent/actionpair.The event can either be auser-initiated system call (CONNECT,LISTEN,SEND,orCLOSE), a segment arrival(SYN,FIN,ACK,orRST), or,inone case, a timeout of twice the maximum packetlifetime. Theaction is the sending of a control segment (SYN,FIN,orRST)ornothing, indicated by –.Comments are shown in parentheses.One can best understand the diagram by first following the path of a client (theheavy solid line), then later following the path of a server (the heavy dashed line).When an application program on the client machine issues aCONNECTrequest, thelocal TCP entity creates a connection record, marks it as being in theSYN SENTstate, and shoots offaSYNsegment.

Ifthe sender transmits a 2048-byte segment that is correctly received, the receiverwill acknowledge the segment. However, since it nowhas only 2048 bytes of buff-er space (until the application removessome data from the buffer), it will advertiseawindowof2048 starting at the next byte expected.Nowthe sender transmits another 2048 bytes, which are acknowledged, but theadvertised windowisofsize 0.The sender must stop until the application processon the receiving host has removedsome data from the buffer,atwhich time TCPcan advertise a larger windowand more data can be sent.When the windowis0,the sender may not normally send segments, with twoexceptions. First,urgent data may be sent, for example, to allowthe user to kill theprocess running on the remote machine.Second, the sender may send a 1-bytesegment to force the receivertoreannounce the next byte expected and the windowsize. Thispacket is called awindowprobe.The TCP standard explicitly providesthis option to prevent deadlock if a windowupdate evergets lost.Senders are not required to transmit data as soon as theycome in from theapplication. Neitherare receivers required to send acknowledgements as soon aspossible. For example, in Fig.6-40, when the first 2 KB of data came in, TCP,knowing that it had a 4-KB window, would have been completely correct in justbuffering the data until another 2 KB came in, to be able to transmit a segmentwith a 4-KB payload.This freedom can be used to improve performance.Consider a connection to a remote terminal, for example using SSH or telnet,that reacts on every keystroke. Inthe worst case, wheneveracharacter arrivesatthe sending TCP entity,TCP creates a 21-byte TCP segment, which it givestoIPto send as a 41-byte IP datagram.At the receiving side, TCP immediately sends a40-byte acknowledgement (20 bytes of TCP header and 20 bytes of IP header).Later,when the remote terminal has read the byte, TCP sends a windowupdate,moving the window1byte to the right.This packet is also 40 bytes.Finally,whenthe remote terminal has processed the character,itechoes the character for localdisplay using a 41-byte packet. Inall, 162 bytes of bandwidth are consumed and'),\n",

Ifmanypieces ofdata are sent by the application in one round-trip time, Nagle’salgorithm will putthe manypieces in one segment, greatly reducing the bandwidth used.The algo-rithm additionally says that a newsegment should be sent if enough data havetrickled in to fill a maximum segment.Nagle’salgorithm is widely used by TCP implementations, but there are timeswhen it is better to disable it.In particular,ininteractive games that are run overthe Internet, the players typically want a rapid stream of short update packets.Gathering the updates to send them in bursts makes the game respond erratically,which makes for unhappyusers. A more subtle problem is that Nagle’salgorithmcan sometimes interact with delayed acknowledgements to cause a temporarydeadlock: the receiverwaits for data on which to piggyback an acknowledgement,and the sender waits on the acknowledgement to send more data. This interactioncan delay the downloads of Web pages. Because of these problems, Nagle’salgo-rithm can be disabled (which is called theTCPNODELAYoption). MogulandMinshall (2001) discuss this and other solutions.Another problem that can degrade TCP performance is thesilly windowsyn-drome(Clark, 1982).This problem occurs when data are passed to the sendingTCP entity in large blocks, but an interactive application on the receiving sidereads data only 1 byte at a time.To see the problem, look at Fig.6-41. Initially,the TCP buffer on the receiving side is full (i.e., it has a windowofsize 0) and thesender knows this.Then the interactive application reads one character from theTCP stream.This action makes the receiving TCP happy, soitsends a windowupdate to the sender saying that it is all right to send 1 byte.The sender obligesand sends 1 byte.The buffer is nowfull, so the receiveracknowledges the 1-bytesegment and sets the windowto0.This behavior can go on forever.Clark’ssolution is to prevent the receiverfrom sending a windowupdate for1byte.

Instead,it shouldwait until it can send a full segment, or at least one containing half of the receiver’sbuffer size.Nagle’salgorithm and Clark’ssolution to the silly windowsyndrome are com-plementary.Nagle was trying to solvethe problem caused by the sending applica-tion delivering data to TCP a byte at a time.Clark was trying to solvethe problemof the receiving application sucking the data up from TCP a byte at a time.Bothsolutions are valid and can work together.The goal is for the sender not to sendsmall segments and the receivernot to ask for them.The receiving TCP can go further in improving performance than just doingwindowupdates in large units.Likethe sending TCP,itcan also buffer data, so it'),\n",

Doingso reduces the number of calls to TCP (and the overhead).

Thequestion that arises is: howlong should the timeout be?This problem is much more difficult in the transport layer than in data link pro-tocols such as 802.11.In the latter case, the expected delay is measured inmicroseconds and is highly predictable (i.e., has a lowvariance), so the timer canbe set to go offjust slightly after the acknowledgement is expected, as shown inFig. 6-42(a).Since acknowledgements are rarely delayed in the data link layer(due to lack of congestion), the absence of an acknowledgement at the expectedtime generally means either the frame or the acknowledgement has been lost.T T1 T20.3\\n0.2\\n0.1\\n001020Round-trip time (microseconds)(a) (b)\\nProbability\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.1\\n0 Probability\\n30405001020Round-trip time (milliseconds)304050\\nFigure6-42.(a) Probability density of acknowledgement arrivaltimes in thedata linklayer.(b) Probability density of acknowledgement arrivaltimes for TCP.TCP is faced with a radically different environment.

Determiningtheround-trip time to the destination is tricky. Evenwhen it is known, deciding on thetimeout interval is also difficult.

Ifit is set too long (e.g.,T2), performance will suffer due to thelong retransmission delay wheneverapacket is lost.Furthermore, the mean andvariance of the acknowledgement arrivaldistribution can change rapidly within afewseconds as congestion builds up or is resolved.The solution is to use a dynamic algorithm that constantly adapts the timeoutinterval, based on continuous measurements of network performance.The algo-rithm generally used by TCP is due to Jacobson (1988) and works as follows.

Typically,_ = 7/8.This kind of formula is anEWMA(ExponentiallyWeighted Moving Average)orlow-pass filter that discards noise in the samples.Even givenagood value ofSRTT,choosing a suitable retransmission timeoutis a nontrivial matter.Initial implementations of TCP used 2xRTT,but experienceshowed that a constant value was too inflexible because it failed to respond whenthe variance went up. In particular,queueing models of random (i.e., Poisson) traf-ficpredict that when the load approaches capacity,the delay becomes large andhighly variable. Thiscan lead to the retransmission timer firing and a copyofthepacket being retransmitted although the original packet is still transiting the net-work. It is all the more likely to happen under conditions of high load, which is theworst time at which to send additional packets into the network.To fix this problem, Jacobson proposed making the timeout value sensitive tothe variance in round-trip times as well as the smoothed round-trip time. Thischange requires keeping track of another smoothed variable,RTTVAR(Round-TripTime VARiation) that is updated using the formulaRTTVAR= ` RTTVAR+ (1< ` )|SRTT< R|This is an EWMA as before, and typically` = 3/4.The retransmission timeout,RTO,isset to be RTO= SRTT+ 4× RTTVARThe choice of the factor 4 is somewhat arbitrary,but multiplication by 4 can bedone with a single shift, and less than 1% of all packets come in more than fourstandard deviations late. Note thatRTTVARis not exactly the same as the standarddeviation (it is really the mean deviation), but it is close enough in practice. Jacob-son’spaper is full of clevertricks to compute timeouts using only integer adds,subtracts, and shifts. This economy is not needed for modern hosts, but it hasbecome part of the culture that allows TCP to run on all manner of devices, fromsupercomputers down to tinydevices. So far nobody has put it on an RFID chip,butsomeday? Who knows.More details of howtocompute this timeout, including initial settings of thevariables, are giveninRFC 2988.The retransmission timer is also held to a mini-mum of 1 second, regardless of the estimates. This is a conservative (albeit some-what empirical) value chosen to prevent spurious retransmissions based on meas-urements (Allman and Paxson, 1999).'),\n",

Whenthe acknowledge-ment comes in, it is unclear whether the acknowledgement refers to the first trans-mission or a later one.Guessing wrong can seriously contaminate the retransmis-sion timeout.Phil Karn discovered this problem the hard way.Karn is an amateurradio enthusiast interested in transmitting TCP/IP packets by ham radio, a notori-ously unreliable medium.He made a simple proposal: do not update estimates onanysegments that have been retransmitted.Additionally,the timeout is doubled oneach successive retransmission until the segments get through the first time.ThisfixiscalledKarn’salgorithm(Karn and Partridge, 1987).Most TCP imple-mentations use it.The retransmission timer is not the only timer TCP uses.Asecond timer is thepersistence timer.Itisdesigned to prevent the following deadlock.The receiversends an acknowledgement with a windowsize of 0, telling the sender to wait.Later,the receiverupdates the window, but the packet with the update is lost.Nowthe sender and the receiverare each waiting for the other to do something.Whenthe persistence timer goes off, the sender transmits a probe to the receiver. The re-sponse to the probe givesthe windowsize. Ifit is still 0, the persistence timer isset again and the cycle repeats.If it is nonzero, data can nowbesent.Athird timer that some implementations use is thekeepalive timer.When aconnection has been idle for a long time, the keepalive timer may go offtocauseone sideto checkwhether theother sideis still there.If it fails to respond, the con-nection is terminated.This feature is controversial because it adds overhead andmay terminate an otherwise healthyconnection due to a transient network parti-tion.The last timer used on each TCP connection is the one used in theTIME WAITstate while closing.It runs for twice the maximum packet lifetime to makesurethat when a connection is closed, all packets created by it have died off.6.5.10 TCPCongestion ControlWe havesavedone of the key functions of TCP for last: congestion control.When the load offered to anynetwork is more than it can handle, congestion buildsup. TheInternet is no exception. The network layer detects congestion whenqueues growlarge at routers and tries to manage it, if only by dropping packets. Itis up to the transport layer to receive congestion feedback from the network layerand slowdownthe rate of trafficthat it is sending into the network. Inthe Internet,TCP plays the main role in controlling congestion, as well as the main role in reli-able transport.That is whyitissuch a special protocol.We covered the general situation of congestion control back in Sec. 6.3.Onekeytakeawaythere was that a transport protocol using an additive increase multi-plicative decrease control lawinresponse to binary congestion signals from the'),\n",

TCPadjusts the size of the windowaccording to the AIMD rule.Recall that the congestion windowismaintainedin additionto the flowcontrolwindow, which specifies the number of bytes that the receivercan buffer.Bothwindows are tracked in parallel, and the number of bytes that may be sent is thesmaller of the twowindows. Thus,the effective windowisthe smaller of what thesender thinks is all right and what the receiverthinks is all right.It takes twototango. TCPwill stop sending data if either the congestion or the flowcontrol win-dowistemporarily full.If the receiversays ‘‘send 64 KB’’but the sender knowsthat bursts of more than 32 KB clog the network, it will send 32 KB.On the otherhand, if the receiversays ‘‘send 64 KB’’and the sender knows that bursts of up to128 KB get through effortlessly,itwill send the full 64 KB requested.The flowcontrol windowwas described earlier,and in what follows we will only describethe congestion window.Modern congestion control was added to TCP largely through the efforts ofVanJacobson (1988). It is a fascinating story.Starting in 1986, the growing popu-larity of the early Internet led to the first occurrence of what became known as acongestion collapse,aprolonged period during which goodput dropped precipi-tously (i.e., by more than a factor of 100) due to congestion in the network. Jacob-son (and manyothers) set out to understand what was happening and remedy thesituation.The high-levelfix that Jacobson implemented was to approximate an AIMDcongestion window. The interesting part, and much of the complexity of TCP con-gestion control, is howheadded this to an existing implementation without chang-ing anyofthe message formats, which made it instantly deployable. Tostart, heobserved that packet loss is a suitable signal of congestion. This signal comes a lit-tle late (as the network is already congested) but it is quite dependable. After all, itis difficult to build a router that does not drop packets when it is overloaded. Thisfact is unlikely to change.Even when terabyte memories appear to buffer vastnumbers of packets, we will probably have terabit/sec networks to fill up thosememories.However, using packet loss as a congestion signal depends on transmissionerrors being relatively rare. This is not normally the case for wireless links such as802.11, which is whytheyinclude their own retransmission mechanism at the linklayer.Because of wireless retransmissions, network layer packet loss due to trans-mission errors is normally masked on wireless networks. It is also rare on otherlinks because wires and optical fibers typically have low bit-error rates.All the Internet TCP algorithms assume that lost packets are caused by conges-tion and monitor timeouts and look for signs of trouble the way miners watch their'),\n",

Agood retransmission timer is needed in order to detect packet loss sig-nals accurately and in a timely manner.Wehavealready discussed howthe TCPretransmission timer includes estimates of the mean and variation in round-triptimes. Fixing this timer,byincluding the variation factor,was an important step inJacobson’swork. Givenagood retransmission timeout, the TCP sender can trackthe outstanding number of bytes, which are loading the network. Itsimply looks atthe difference between the sequence numbers that are transmitted and acknow-ledged.Nowitseems that our task is easy.All we need to do is to track the congestionwindow, using sequence and acknowledgement numbers, and adjust the congestionwindowusing an AIMD rule.As you might have expected, it is more complicatedthan that. A first consideration is that the way packets are sent into the network,evenovershort periods of time, must be matched to the network path.Otherwisethe trafficwill cause congestion.Forexample, consider a host with a congestionwindowof64KBattached to a 1-Gbps switched Ethernet.If the host sends theentire windowatonce, this burst of trafficmay traveloveraslow1-Mbps ADSLline further along the path. The burst that took only half a millisecond on the1-Gbps line will clog the 1-Mbps line for half a second, completely disrupting pro-tocols such as voice overIP. This behavior might be a good idea for a protocoldesigned to cause congestion, but not for a protocol to control it.However, itturns out that we can use small bursts of packets to our advantage.Fig. 6-43shows what happens when a sender on a fast network (the 1-Gbps link)sends a small burst of four packets to a receiveronaslownetwork (the 1-Mbpslink) that is the bottleneck or slowest part of the path.Initially the four packetstraveloverthe link as quickly as theycan be sent by the sender.Atthe router,theyare queued while being sent because it takes longer to send a packet overthe slowlink than to receive the next packet overthe fast link.But the queue is not largebecause only a small number of packets were sent at once.Note the increasedlength of the packets on the slowlink. The same packet, of 1 KB say,isnow longerbecause it takes more time to send it on a slowlink than on a fast one.Fast link Slow link(bottleneck)1: Burst of packetssent on fast link 2: Burst queues at routerand drains onto slow link \\n3: Receive acks packetsat slow link rate 4: Acks preserve slowlink timing at senderAck clock ReceiverSender . . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .\\nFigure6-43.Aburst of packets from a sender and the returning ack clock.Eventually the packets get to the receiver, where theyare acknowledged.

Theyare spread out compared to the origi-nal packets on the fast link. As these acknowledgements traveloverthe networkand back to the sender theypreservethis timing.The key observation is this: the acknowledgements return to the sender atabout the rate that packets can be sent overthe slowest link in the path. This is pre-cisely the rate that the sender wants to use. If it injects newpackets into the net-work at this rate, theywill be sent as fast as the slowlink permits, but theywill notqueue up and congest anyrouter along the path. This timing is known as anackclock.Itisanessential part of TCP.Byusing an ack clock, TCP smoothes outtrafficand avoids unnecessary queues at routers.Asecond consideration is that the AIMD rule will takeavery long time toreach a good operating point on fast networks if the congestion windowisstartedfrom a small size. Consider a modest network path that can support 10 Mbps withan RTT of 100 msec. The appropriate congestion windowisthe bandwidth-delayproduct, which is 1 Mbit or 100 packets of 1250 bytes each. If the congestion win-dowstarts at 1 packet and increases by 1 packet every RTT,itwill be 100 RTTs or10 seconds before the connection is running at about the right rate. That is a longtime to wait just to get to the right speed for a transfer.Wecould reduce this startuptime by starting with a larger initial window, say of 50 packets. Butthis windowwould be far too large for sloworshort links.It would cause congestion if used allat once, as we have just described.Instead, the solution Jacobson chose to handle both of these considerations is amix of linear and multiplicative increase. When a connection is established, thesender initializes the congestion windowtoasmall initial value of at most foursegments; the details are described in RFC 3390, and the use of four segments is anincrease from an earlier initial value of one segment based on experience. Thesender then sends the initial window. The packets will takearound-trip time to beacknowledged. For each segment that is acknowledged before the retransmissiontimer goes off, the sender adds one segment’sworth of bytes to the congestion win-dow. Plus, as that segment has been acknowledged, there is nowone less segmentin the network. The upshot is that every acknowledged segment allows twomoresegments to be sent.The congestion windowisdoubling every round-trip time.This algorithm is calledslowstart,but it is not slowatall—it is exponentialgrowth—except in comparison to the previous algorithm that let an entire flowcontrol windowbesent all at once. Slowstart is shown in Fig.6-44. Inthe firstround-trip time, the sender injects one packet into the network (and the receiverre-ceivesone packet). Two packets are sent in the next round-trip time, then fourpackets in the third round-trip time.Slowstart works well overarange of link speeds and round-trip times, anduses an ack clock to match the rate of sender transmissions to the network path.Take a look at the way acknowledgements return from the sender to the receiverinFig. 6-44.When the sender gets an acknowledgement, it increases the congestionwindowbyone and immediately sends twopackets into the network.

Atall times, the number of unacknow-ledged packets is givenbythe congestion window.)However, these twopacketswill not necessarily arrive atthe receiverasclosely spaced as when theywere sent.Forexample, suppose the sender is on a 100-Mbps Ethernet. Each packet of 1250bytes takes 100µ sec to send. So the delay between the packets can be as small as100µ sec. The situation changes if these packets go across a 1-Mbps ADSL linkanywhere along the path. It nowtakes 10 msec to send the same packet. Thismeans that the minimum spacing between the twopackets has grown by a factor of100. Unless the packets have towait together in a queue on a later link, the spacingwill remain large.In Fig.6-44, this effect is shown by enforcing a minimum spacing betweendata packets arriving at the receiver. The same spacing is kept when the receiversends acknowledgements, and thus when the sender receivesthe acknowledge-ments. Ifthe network path is slow, acknowledgements will come in slowly (after adelay of an RTT). Ifthe network path is fast, acknowledgements will come inquickly (again, after the RTT). Allthe sender has to do is followthe timing of theack clock as it injects newpackets, which is what slowstart does.Because slowstart causes exponential growth, eventually (and sooner ratherthan later) it will send too manypackets into the network too quickly.When thishappens, queues will build up in the network. Whenthe queues are full, one ormore packets will be lost. After this happens, the TCP sender will time out whenan acknowledgement fails to arrive intime. There is evidence of slowstart growingtoo fast in Fig.6-44. Afterthree RTTs, four packets are in the network. These fourpackets takeanentire RTT to arrive atthe receiver. That is, a congestion windowof four packets is the right size for this connection.However, asthese packets areacknowledged, slowstart continues to growthe congestion window, reaching eightpackets in another RTT.Only four of these packets can reach the receiverinone'),\n",

That is, the network pipe is full.Additionalpackets placed into the network by the sender will build up in router queues, sincetheycannot be delivered to the receiverquickly enough. Congestion and packetloss will occur soon.To keep slowstart under control, the sender keeps a threshold for the con-nection called theslowstart threshold.Initially this value is set arbitrarily high,to the size of the flowcontrol window, sothat it will not limit the connection.TCPkeeps increasing the congestion windowinslowstart until a timeout occurs or thecongestion windowexceeds the threshold (or the receiver’swindowisfilled).Wheneverapacket loss is detected, for example, by a timeout, the slowstartthreshold is set to half of the congestion windowand the entire process is restarted.The idea is that the current windowistoo large because it caused congestion previ-ously that is only nowdetected by a timeout. Half of the window, which was usedsuccessfully earlier,isprobably a better estimate for a congestion windowthat isclose to the path capacity without causing loss.In our example in Fig.6-44, grow-ing the congestion windowtoeight packets may cause loss, while the congestionwindowoffour packets in the previous RTT was the right value. Thecongestionwindowisthen reset to its small initial value and slowstart resumes.Wheneverthe slowstart threshold is crossed, TCP switches from slowstart toadditive increase. In this mode, the congestion windowisincreased by one seg-ment every round-trip time.Likeslowstart, this is usually implemented with anincrease for every segment that is acknowledged, rather than an increase once perRTT. Call the congestion windowcwndand the maximum segment sizeMSS.Acommon approximation is to increasecwndby (MSS× MSS)/cwndfor each of thecwnd/MSSpackets that may be acknowledged. This increase does not need to befast. The whole idea is for a TCP connection to spend a lot of time with its conges-tion windowclose to the optimum value—not so small that throughput will be low,and not so large that congestion will occur.Additive increase is shown in Fig.6-45 for the same situation as slowstart. Atthe end of every RTT,the sender’scongestion windowhas grown enough that itcan inject an additional packet into the network. Compared to slowstart, the linearrate of growth is much slower.Itmakes little difference for small congestion win-dows, as is the case here, but a large difference in the time taken to growthe con-gestion windowto100 segments, for example.There is something else that we can do to improve performance. Thedefect inthe scheme so far is waiting for a timeout.Timeouts are relatively long becausetheymust be conservative.After a packet is lost, the receivercannot acknowledgepast it, so the acknowledgement number will stay fixed, and the sender will not beable to send anynew packets into the network because its congestion windowremains full.This condition can continue for a relatively long period until thetimer fires and the lost packet is sent again. Atthat stage, TCP slowstarts again.There is a quick way for the sender to recognize that one of its packets hasbeen lost. As packets beyond the lost packet arrive atthe receiver, theytrigger'),\n",

Thus, TCP somewhat arbitrarily assumes that three duplicateacknowledgements imply that a packet has been lost. The identity of the lost pack-et can be inferred from the acknowledgement number as well.It is the very nextpacket in sequence. This packet can then be retransmitted right away, before theretransmission timeout fires.This heuristic is calledfast retransmission.After it fires, the slowstartthreshold is still set to half the current congestion window, just as with a timeout.Slowstart can be restarted by setting the congestion windowtoone packet. Withthis windowsize, a newpacket will be sent after the one round-trip time that ittakes to acknowledge the retransmitted packet along with all data that had beensent before the loss was detected.An illustration of the congestion algorithm we have built up so far is shown inFig. 6-46.This version of TCP is called TCP Tahoe after the 4.2BSD Tahoerelease in 1988 in which it was included.The maximum segment size here is 1KB.

Restarting with a congestion windowofone packet takes oneround-trip time for all of the previously transmitted data to leave the network andbe acknowledged, including the retransmitted packet. Thecongestion windowgrows with slowstart as it did previously,until it reaches the newthreshold of 20KB. At that time, the growth becomes linear again. It will continue in this fashionuntil another packet loss is detected via duplicate acknowledgements or a timeout(or the receiver’swindowbecomes the limit).TCP Tahoe (which included good retransmission timers) provided a workingcongestion control algorithm that solved the problem of congestion collapse.Jacobson realized that it is possible to do evenbetter.Atthe time of the fastretransmission, the connection is running with a congestion windowthat is toolarge, but it is still running with a working ack clock.Every time another duplicateacknowledgement arrives, it is likely that another packet has left the network.Using duplicate acknowledgements to count the packets in the network, makes itpossible to let some packets exit the network and continue to send a newpacket foreach additional duplicate acknowledgement.Fast recoveryis the heuristic that implements this behavior.Itisatemporarymode that aims to maintain the ack clock running with a congestion windowthat isthe newthreshold, or half the value of the congestion windowatthe time of the'),\n",

Todothis, duplicate acknowledgements are counted (includingthe three that triggered fast retransmission) until the number of packets in the net-work has fallen to the newthreshold. This takes about half a round-trip time.Fromthen on, a newpacket can be sent for each duplicate acknowledgement that isreceived. One round-trip time after the fast retransmission, the lost packet will havebeen acknowledged. At that time, the stream of duplicate acknowledgements willcease and fast recovery mode will be exited. The congestion windowwill be set tothe newslowstart threshold and grows by linear increase.The upshot of this heuristic is that TCP avoids slowstart, except when the con-nection is first started and when a timeout occurs.

For example, the TCP NewReno versionuses a partial advance of the acknowledgement number after a retransmission tofind and repair another loss (Hoe, 1996), as described in RFC 3782.Since themid-1990s, several variations have emerged that followthe principles we havedescribed but use slightly different control laws. For example, Linux uses a variantcalled CUBIC TCP (Ha et al., 2008) and Windows includes a variant called Com-pound TCP (Tan et al., 2006).Twolarger changes have also affected TCP implementations.First, much ofthe complexity of TCP comes from inferring from a stream of duplicate acknowl-edgements which packets have arrivedand which packets have been lost.Thecumulative acknowledgement number does not provide this information.Asimplefixisthe use of SACK, which lists up to three ranges of bytes that have beenreceived. With this information, the sender can more directly decide what packetsto retransmit and track the packets in flight to implement the congestion window.When the sender and receiverset up a connection, theyeach send theSACKpermittedTCP option to signal that theyunderstand selective acknowledgements.Once SACK is enabled for a connection, it works as shown in Fig.6-48. Are-ceiveruses the TCPAcknowledgement numberfield in the normal manner,asacumulative acknowledgement of the highest in-order byte that has been received.When it receivespacket 3 out of order (because packet 2 was lost), it sends aSACKoptionfor the receiveddata along with the (duplicate) cumulative acknowledge-ment for packet 1. TheSACK optiongivesthe byte ranges that have been receivedabove the number givenbythe cumulative acknowledgement. The first range is thepacket that triggered the duplicate acknowledgement. The next ranges, if present,are older blocks. Up to three ranges are commonly used.By the time packet 6 isreceived, twoSACKbyte ranges are used to indicate that packet 6 and packets 3 to4havebeen received, in addition to all packets up to packet 1.From the infor-mation in eachSACK optionthat it receives, the sender can decide which packetsto retransmit.In this case, retransmitting packets 2 and 5 would be a good idea.\\n654321Lost packets\\nACK: 1ACK: 1SACK: 3ACK: 1SACK: 3-4ACK: 1 SACK: 6, 3-4Sender Receiver\\nRetransmit 2 and 5!\\nFigure6-48.Selective acknowledgements.SACK is strictly advisory information.

SACK is nowwidely deployed. Itisdescribed in RFC 2883, and TCP congestion control using SACK is described inRFC 3517.The second change is the use of ECN in addition to packet loss as a congestionsignal. ECNis an IP layer mechanism to notify hosts of congestion that we de-scribed in Sec. 5.3.2.With it, the TCP receivercan receive congestion signalsfrom IP.The use of ECN is enabled for a TCP connection when both the sender and re-ceiverindicate that theyare capable of using ECN by setting theECEandCWRbits during connection establishment.If ECN is used, each packet that carries aTCP segment is flagged in the IP header to showthat it can carry an ECN signal.Routers that support ECN will set a congestion signal on packets that can carryECN flags when congestion is approaching, instead of dropping those packets aftercongestion has occurred.The TCP receiverisinformed if anypacket that arrivescarries an ECN conges-tion signal. The receiverthen uses theECE(ECN Echo) flag to signal the TCPsender that its packets have experienced congestion. The sender tells the receiverthat it has heard the signal by using theCWR(Congestion WindowReduced) flag.The TCP sender reacts to these congestion notifications in exactly the samewayasitdoes to packet loss that is detected via duplicate acknowledgements.However, the situation is strictly better.Congestion has been detected and nopacket was harmed in anyway.ECN is described in RFC 3168.It requires bothhost and router support, and is not yet widely used on the Internet.Formore information on the complete set of congestion control behaviors thatare implemented in TCP,see RFC 5681.6.5.11 TCPCUBICTo cope with increasingly large bandwidth-delay products,TCP CUBICwasdeveloped (Ha et al., 2008).As previously described, networks with large band-width-delay products takemanyround-trip times to reach the available capacity ofthe end-to-end path.The general approach behind TCP CUBIC is to increase thecongestion windowinsuch a way that is a function of the time since the last dupli-cate acknowledgment, rather than simply based on the arrivalofACKs.CUBIC also adjusts its congestion windowdifferently as a function of time. Incontrast to the standard AIMD congestion control approach as we described above,the congestion windowincreases according to a cubic function, which initially hasagrowth in the congestion window, followed by a plateau period, and finally aperiod of faster growth. Figure6-49 shows the evolution of TCP CUBIC’sconges-tion windowovertime.

In particular,connection-oriented proto-cols such as TCP can suffer from high connection setup overhead, as well as per-formance issues on networks with large buffers. In the remainder of this section,we discuss some recent developments in transport protocols to address theseissues.6.6.1 QUIC: Quick UDP Internet ConnectionsQUIC,initially proposed as (Quick UDP Internet Connections)isatransportprotocol that aims to improve some of the throughput and latencycharacteristics ofTCP.Itwas used in more than half of the connections from the Chrome browser toGoogle’sservices before it was everstandardized. However, most Web browsersother than Google Chrome do not support the protocol.As its name suggests, QUIC runs on top of UDP and its main goal has been tomakeapplication protocols such as the Web protocols (discussed in Chap. 7) faster.We will discuss howQUIC interacts with the Web’sapplication protocols in somemore detail in Chap. 7. As we will soon see, an application such as the Web relies'),\n",

If some data is lost in one stream, the protocol can continue transferringdata for other streams independently,which can ultimately improve the per-formance of links with high transmission error rates. QUIC also makes variousother optimizations to improve performance, such as piggybacking applica-tion-levelencryption information on transport-connection establishment, andencrypting each packet individually so that the loss of one packet does not preventdecryption of subsequent packets. QUIC also provides mechanisms for improvingthe speed of network handoff(e.g., from a cellular connection to a WiFi con-nection), using a connection identifier as a way to maintain state when endpointschange networks.6.6.2 BBR:Congestion Control Based on Bottleneck BandwidthWhen bottleneck buffers are large, loss-based congestion control algorithmssuch as those described earlier end up filling these buffers causing a phenomenonknown asbufferbloat.The idea behind bufferbloat is fairly straightforward: whennetwork devices in along a network path have buffers that are too large, a TCPsender with a large congestion windowcan send at a rate that far exceeds thecapacity of the network before it everreceivesaloss signal. Buffers in the middleof the network can fill up, delaying congestion events for senders that are sendingtoo fast (i.e., not dropping packets) and, importantly,increasing the networklatencyfor senders whose packets are queued behind the packets in a large buffer(Gettys, 2011).Addressing bufferbloat can be achievedinanumber of ways. One possibleapproach is simply to reduce the size of buffers in network devices; unfortunately,this requires convincing vendors and manufacturers of network devices, from wire-less access points to backbone routers, to reduce the size of the buffers in theirdevices. Even if that battle could be won, there are far too manylegacy devices inthe network to rely on this approach alone.Another approach is to develop an al-ternative toloss-based congestion control, which is the approach BBR takes.The main idea behind BBR is to measure the bottleneck bandwidth and theround-trip propagation delay and use estimates of these parameters to send at ex-actly the appropriate operating point.BBR thuscontinuouslytracks the bottleneckbandwidth and the round-trip propagation delay.TCP already tracks the round-triptime; BBR extends existing functionality by tracking the delivery rate of the tran-sport protocol overtime. BBR effectively computes the bottleneck bandwidth as'),\n",

Once the amount of packets in flight exceeds the bandwidth-delay product,latencybegins to increase as packets are queued, and the delivery rate plateaus. Itis at this point that BBR seeks to operate.Fig. 6-50shows howthe round trip timeand delivery rate vary with the amount of data in flight (i.e., sent, but not acknow-ledged). The optimal operating point for BBR occurs when increasing the amountof trafficinflight increases the overall round-trip time but does not increase thedelivery rate.\\nRoundTrip Time\\nDeliveryRate\\nPropagationDelaySlope = 1/Bottleneck BW\\nSlope = 1/Propagation Delay\\nData In Flight\\nData In Flight\\nBottleneck Bandwidth\\nFigure6-50.BBR Operating Point.The key toBBR is thus to continually update estimates of the bottleneck band-width and round-trip latencyaccordingly.Each acknowledgement provides new,updated information about round-trip times and average delivery rates, with checksto makesure that the delivery rate is not application-limited (as is sometimes thecase in request-response protocols). The second part of BBR is pacing the dataitself to match the bottleneck bandwidth rate.Thepacing rateis the critical pa-rameter for BBR-based congestion control. In steady state, the rate at which BBRsends is simply a function of the bottleneck bandwidth and the round-trip time.'),\n",

Convergence to the bottleneck rate is quite fast.Google has deployed BBR in a fairly widespread fashion, both on its internalbackbone network, as well as in may of its applications. One open question, how-ever, ishow well BBR-based congestion control competes with conventional TCP-based congestion control. in one recent experiment, for example, researchersdiscovered that a BBR sender was consuming 40% of link capacity when sharing anetwork path with 16 other transport connections, each of which receivedless than4% of the remaining bandwidth (Ware et al., 2019). It can be shown that BBRoften takes a fixed share of available capacity,regardless of the number of compet-ing TCP flows. Unfortunately,the state of the art for analyzing the fairness proper-ties of newcongestion control algorithms is simply to try them out and see whathappens. In this case, it seems that there remains significant work to be done toensure that BBR interacts well with existing TCP trafficonthe Internet.6.6.3 TheFutureofTCPAs the workhorse of the Internet, TCP has been used for manyapplicationsand extended overtime to give good performance overawide range of networks.Manyversions are deployed with slightly different implementations than the clas-sic algorithms we have described, especially for congestion control and robustnessagainst attacks.It is likely that TCP will continue to evolvewith the Internet.Wewill mention twoparticular issues.The first one is that TCP does not provide the transport semantics that allapplications want. For example, some applications want to send messages orrecords whose boundaries need to be preserved. Otherapplications work with agroup of related conversations, such as a Web browser that transfers several objectsfrom the same server.Still other applications want better control overthe networkpaths that theyuse. TCP with its standard sockets interface does not meet theseneeds well. Essentially,the application has the burden of dealing with anyproblemnot solved by TCP.This has led to proposals for newprotocols that would provideaslightly different interface. Two examples are SCTP and SST.However, when-eversomeone proposes changing something that has worked so well for so long,there is always a huge battle between the ‘‘Users are demanding more features’’and ‘‘If it ain’tbroke, don’tfix it’’camps.6.7 PERFORMANCEISSUESPerformance issues are critically important in computer networks.

Inthe following sections, we will examinemanyissues related to network performance to see what kinds of problems existand what can be done about them.Unfortunately,understanding network performance is more an art than a sci-ence. Thereis little underlying theory that is actually of anyuse in practice.Thebest we can do is give some rules of thumb gained from hard experience and pres-ent examples taken from the real world. Wehavedelayed this discussion until westudied the transport layer because the performance that applications receivedepends on the combined performance of the transport, network, and link layers,and to be able to use TCP as an example in various places.In the next sections, we will look at eight aspects of network performance:1. Performanceproblems.2. Measuringnetwork performance.3. Measuringaccess network throughput.4. Measuringquality of experience.5. Hostdesign for fast networks.6. Fast segment processing.7. Headercompression.8. Protocolsfor ‘‘long fat’’networks.These aspects consider network performance both at the host and across the net-work, and as networks are increased in speed and size.6.7.1 Performance Problems in Computer NetworksSome performance problems, such as congestion, are caused by temporaryresource overloads. Ifmore trafficsuddenly arrivesatarouter than the router canhandle, congestion will build up and performance will suffer.Westudied conges-tion in detail in this chapter and in Chap. 5.Performance also degrades when there is a structural resource imbalance.Forexample, if a gigabit communication line is attached to a low-end PC, the poor hostwill not be able to process the incoming packets fast enough and some will be lost.These packets will eventually be retransmitted, adding delay,wasting bandwidth,and generally reducing performance.Overloads can also be synchronously triggered.As an example, if a segmentcontains a bad parameter (e.g., the port for which it is destined), in manycases thereceiverwill thoughtfully send back an error notification. Nowconsider whatcould happen if a bad segment is broadcast to 1000 machines: each one might sendback an error message.The resultingbroadcast stormcould cripple the network.'),\n",

Wireless networks must be particularly careful to avoid uncheckedbroadcast responses because broadcast occurs naturally and the wireless bandwidthis limited.Asecond example of synchronous overload is what happens after an electricalpower failure. Whenthe power comes back on, all the machines simultaneouslystart rebooting.Atypical reboot sequence might require first going to some(DHCP) server to learn one’strue identity,and then to some file server to get acopyofthe operating system.If hundreds of machines in a data center all do thisat once, the server will probably collapse under the load.Even in the absence of synchronous overloads and the presence of sufficientresources, poor performance can occur due to lack of system tuning.Forexample,if a machine has plenty of CPU power and memory but not enough of the memoryhas been allocated for buffer space, flowcontrol will slowdownsegment receptionand limit performance.This was a problem for manyTCP connections as theInternet became faster but the default size of the flowcontrol windowstayed fixedat 64 KB.Another tuning issue is setting timeouts.When a segment is sent, a timer is setto guard against loss of the segment. Ifthe timeout is set too short, unnecessaryretransmissions will occur,clogging the wires.If the timeout is set too long,unnecessary delays will occur after a segment is lost.Other tunable parameters in-clude howlong to wait for data on which to piggyback before sending a separateacknowledgement, and howmanyretransmissions to makebefore giving up.Another performance problem that occurs with real-time applications likeaudio and video is jitter.Having enough bandwidth on average is not sufficient forgood performance. Short transmission delays are also required.Consistentlyachieving short delays demands careful engineering of the load on the network,quality-of-service support at the link and network layers, or both.6.7.2 Network Performance MeasurementNetwork operators and users alikeaim to measure the performance of net-works. Apopular measurement to perform, for example, is access networkthroughput measurement (sometimes referred to simply as ‘‘speed’’). For example,manyInternet users have used tools such as Speedtest (i.e.,www.speedtest.net)tomeasure the performance of access networks. The conventional approach for per-forming these tests has long been to send as much trafficonthe network as quicklyas possible (essentially ‘‘filling the pipe’’). Asthe speed of access networksincreases, however, measuring the speed of an access link has become more chal-lenging, as filling the pipe requires more data, and as network bottlenecks betweenthe client and the server under test move elsewhere in the network. Perhaps evenmore importantly,speed is becoming less relevant to network performance than'),\n",

As a result, networkperformance measurement is continuing to evolve, especially in the era of gigabitaccess networks.6.7.3 MeasuringAccess Network ThroughputThe conventional approach to measuring network throughput is simply to sendas much data along a network path as the network will support overagivenperiodof time, and divide the amount of data transferred by the time taken to transfer thedata, thus yielding an average throughput calculation.While seemingly simple andgenerally appropriate, this approach encounters a number of shortcomings: mostimportantly,asingle TCP connection often cannot exhaust the capacity of a net-work link, especially as the speed of access links continues to increase. Addi-tionally,ifthe test captures the early part of the transfer,then the test may capturetransfer rates prior to steady state (e.g., TCP slowstart), which could ultimatelyresult in a test that under-estimates the access network throughput. Finally,cli-ent-based tests (such as speedtest.net or anytype of throughput test one might runfrom a client device) increasingly end up measuring performance limitations otherthan the access network (e.g., the device’sradio, the wireless access network).To account for these shortcomings, which have become increasingly acute asaccess networks nowbegin to exceed gigabit speeds, some best practices haveemerged for measuring access network throughput (Feamster et al., 2020). Thefirst is to use multiple parallel TCP connections to fill the capacity of the accesslink. Tests of early speed tests showed that four TCP connections was typicallysufficient to fill access network capacity (Sundaresan 2011); most modern cli-ent-based tools, including Speedtest and the throughput test used by theFederalTrade Communications use at least four parallel connections to measure networkcapacity.Some of these tools evenscale the number of network connections, sothat connections that appear to have higher capacity are tested with more parallelconnections.Asecond best practice, which has become increasingly important as thethroughput of the ISP access link exceeds that of the home network (and otherparts of the end-to-end path), is to perform access network throughput tests directlyfrom the home router.Performing tests in this fashion minimizes the likelihoodthat extraneous factors (e.g., a client device, the user’swireless network) constrainthe throughput test.As speeds continue to increase, it is likely that additional best practices mayemerge, such as measuring to multiple Internet destinations in parallel from a sin-gle access connection. Such an approach may be necessary,particularly if the ser-verside of these connections becomes the source of more network throughput bot-tlenecks. As speeds continue to increase, there is also an increased interest indeveloping so-called ‘‘passive’’ throughput tests, which do not inject large amountsof additional trafficinto the network but rather watch trafficasittraverses the'),\n",

For example, in thecase of video, a user’sexperience generally does not depend on throughput, past acertain point (Ramachandran et al., 2019). Ultimately,auser’sexperience whenstreaming a video is defined by factors such as howquickly the video starts play-ing (startup delay), whether the video rebuffers, and the resolution of the video.Beyond about 50 Mbps, however, none of these factors particularly depend onaccess link throughput, but rather on other properties of the network (latency, jitter,and so forth).Accordingly,modern network performance measurement is moving beyondsimple speed tests, in an effort to estimate user quality of experience, typicallybased on passive observation of network traffic. These estimators are becomingfairly widespread for streaming video (Ahmed et al., 2017; Krishnamoorthyetal.,2017; Mangla et al., 2018; and Bronzino et al., 2020).The challenges lie in per-forming this type of optimization across a general class of video services, and ulti-mately for a larger class of applications (e.g., gaming, virtual reality).Of course, a user’squality of experience is a measure of whether that person ishappywith the service theyare using. That metric is ultimately a human consider-ation and might evenrequire human feedback (e.g., real-time surveysorfeedbackmechanisms from the user). Internet service providers continue to be interested inmechanisms that can infer or predict user quality of experience and engagementfrom things theycan measure directly (e.g., application throughput, packet loss andinterarrivaltimes, etc.).We are still a ways offfrom seeing automatic estimation of user quality ofexperience based on passive measurement of features in network traffic, but thisarea remains a ripe area for exploration at the intersection of machine learning andnetworking. Ultimately,the applications could go beyond networking, as transportprotocols (and network operators) might evenoptimize resources for users whodemand a higher quality experience. For example, the user who is streaming avideo in a remote part of the house but has walked awaymay care much less aboutthe quality of the application stream than the user who is deeply engrossed in amovie. Ofcourse, distinguishing between a user who is intensely watching a videofrom one who went to the kitchen for a drink and did not bother to hit the pausebutton before departing could be tricky.'),\n",

It is not the link capacity,butthe throughput and delay after network and transport processing.Reducing software overheads improvesperformance by increasing throughputand decreasing delay.Itcan also reduce the energy that is spent on networking,which is an important consideration for mobile computers.Most of these ideashave been common knowledge to network designers for years.Theywere firststated explicitly by Mogul (1993); our treatment largely follows his.Another rele-vant source is Metcalfe (1993).Host Speed Is MoreImportant Than Network SpeedLong experience has shown that in nearly all fast networks, operating systemand protocol overhead dominate actual time on the wire.Forexample, in theory,the minimum RPC time on a 1-Gbps Ethernet is 1µ sec, corresponding to a mini-mum (64-byte) request followed by a minimum (64-byte) reply.Inpractice, over-coming the software overhead and getting the RPC time anywhere near there is asubstantial achievement. It rarely happens in practice.Similarly,the biggest problem in running at 1 Gbps is often getting the bitsfrom the user’sbuffer out onto the network fast enough and having the receivinghost process them as fast as theycome in.If you double the host (CPU and memo-ry) speed, you often can come close to doubling the throughput.Doubling the net-work capacity has no effect if the bottleneck is in the hosts.Reduce Packet Count to Reduce OverheadEach segment has a certain amount of overhead (e.g., the header) as well asdata (e.g., the payload). Bandwidth is required for both components. Processing isalso required for both components (e.g., header processing and doing the check-sum). When1million bytes are being sent, the data cost is the same no matterwhat the segment size is.However, using 128-byte segments means 32 times asmuch per-segment overhead as using 4-KB segments. Thebandwidth and proc-essing overheads add up fast to reduce throughput.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 619}, page_content='596 THE TRANSPORTLAYER CHAP.6Per-packet overhead in the lower layers amplifies this effect. Eacharrivingpacket causes a fresh interrupt if the host is keeping up.On a modern pipelinedprocessor,each interrupt breaks the CPU pipeline, interferes with the cache, re-quires a change to the memory management context, voids the branch predictiontable, and forces a substantial number of CPU registers to be saved. Ann-foldreduction in segments sent thus reduces the interrupt and packet overhead by a fac-tor ofn.Youmight say that both people and computers are poor at multitasking. Thisobservation underlies the desire to send MTU packets that are as large as will passalong the network path without fragmentation.Mechanisms such as Nagle’salgo-rithm and Clark’ssolution are also attempts to avoid sending small packets.Minimize Data TouchingThe most straightforward way to implement a layered protocol stack is withone module for each layer.Unfortunately,this leads to copying (or at least access-ing the data on multiple passes) as each layer does its own work. For example,after a packet is receivedbythe NIC, it is typically copied to a kernel buffer.Fromthere, it is copied to a network layer buffer for network layer processing, then to atransport layer buffer for transport layer processing, and finally to the receiving ap-plication process.It is not unusual for an incoming packet to be copied three orfour times before the segment enclosed in it is delivered.All this copying can greatly degrade performance because memory operationsare an order of magnitude slower than register–register instructions.Forexample,if 20% of the instructions actually go to memory (i.e., are cache misses), which islikely when touching incoming packets, the average instruction execution time isslowed down by a factor of 2.8 (0.8× 1+ 0. 2× 10). Hardware assistance will nothelp here.The problem is too much copying by the operating system.Acleveroperating system will minimize copying by combining the processingof multiple layers. For example, TCP and IP are usually implemented together (as‘‘TCP/IP’’) so that it is not necessary to copythe payload of the packet as proc-essing switches from network to transport layer.Another common trick is to per-form multiple operations within a layer in a single pass overthe data. For example,checksums are often computed while copying the data (when it has to be copied)and the newly computed checksum is appended to the end.Minimize Context SwitchesArelated rule is that context switches (e.g., from kernel mode to user mode)are deadly.Theyhavethe bad properties of interrupts and copying combined.This cost is whytransport protocols are often implemented in the kernel. Likereducing packet count, context switches can be reduced by having the library pro-cedure that sends data do internal buffering until it has a substantial amount of'),\n",

Similarly,onthe receiving side, small incoming segments should be col-lected together and passed to the user in one fell swoop instead of individually,tominimize context switches.In the best case, an incoming packet causes a context switch from the currentuser to the kernel, and then a switch to the receiving process to give itthe newlyarriveddata. Unfortunately,with some operating systems, additional contextswitches happen.Forexample, if the network manager runs as a special process inuser space, a packet arrivalislikely to cause a context switch from the current userto the kernel, then another one from the kernel to the network manager,followedby another one back to the kernel, and finally one from the kernel to the receivingprocess.

Atimer that takes too long to expire adds a small amount ofextra delay to one connection in the (unlikely) event of a segment being lost.Atimer that goes offwhen it should not have used up host resources, wastes band-width, and puts extra load on perhaps dozens of routers for no good reason.6.7.6 Fast Segment ProcessingNowthat we have covered general rules, we will look at some specific meth-ods for speeding up segment processing.Formore information, see Clark et al.(1989), and Chase et al. (2001).Segment processing overhead has twocomponents: overhead per segment andoverhead per byte.Both must be attacked. Thekeytofast segment processing isto separate out the normal, successful case (one-way data transfer) and handle itspecially.Manyprotocols tend to emphasize what to do when something goeswrong (e.g., a packet getting lost), but to makethe protocols run fast, the designershould aim to minimize processing time when everything goes right.Minimizingprocessing time when an error occurs is secondary.Although a sequence of special segments is needed to get into theESTAB-LISHEDstate, once there, segment processing is straightforward until one sidestarts to close the connection.Let us begin by examining the sending side in theESTABLISHEDstate when there are data to be transmitted.Forthe sakeofclarity,we assume here that the transport entity is in the kernel, although the same ideasapply if it is a user-space process or a library inside the sending process.InFig. 6-52,the sending process traps into the kernel to do theSEND.The first thingthe transport entity does is test to see if this is the normal case: the state isESTAB-LISHED,neither side is trying to close the connection, a regular (i.e., not an out-of-band) full segment is being sent, and enough windowspace is available at thereceiver. Ifall conditions are met, no further tests are needed and the fast paththrough the sending transport entity can be taken. Typically,this path is takenmost of the time.In the usual case, the headers of consecutive data segments are almost thesame. Totakeadvantage of this fact, a prototype header is stored within the tran-sport entity.Atthe start of the fast path, it is copied as fast as possible to a scratchbuffer,word by word. Thosefields that change from segment to segment are over-written in the buffer.Frequently,these fields are easily derivedfrom state vari-ables, such as the next sequence number.Apointer to the full segment header plusapointer to the user data are then passed to the network layer.Here, the samestrategy can be followed (not shown in Fig.6-52). Finally,the network layer givesthe resulting packet to the data link layer for transmission.As an example of howthis principle works in practice, let us consider TCP/IP.Figure 6-53(a) shows the TCP header.The fields that are the same between con-secutive segments on a one-way floware shaded.All the sending transport entity'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 623}, page_content='600 THE TRANSPORTLAYER CHAP.6An optimization that often speeds up connection record lookup evenmore is tomaintain a pointer to the last one used and try that one first. Clarket al. (1989)tried this and observed a hit rate exceeding 90%.The segment is checked to see if it is a normal one: the state isESTABLISHED,neither side is trying to close the connection, the segment is a full one, no specialflags are set, and the sequence number is the one expected. Thesetests takejust ahandful of instructions.If all conditions are met, a special fast path TCP procedureis called.The fast path updates the connection record and copies the data to the user.While it is copying, it also computes the checksum, eliminating an extra pass overthe data.If the checksum is correct, the connection record is updated and anacknowledgement is sent back.The general scheme of first making a quick checkto see if the header is what is expected and then having a special procedure handlethat case is calledheader prediction.ManyTCP implementations use it.Whenthis optimization and all the other ones discussed in this chapter are used together,it is possible to get TCP to run at 90% of the speed of a local memory-to-memorycopy, assuming the network itself is fast enough.Twoother areas where substantial performance gains are possible are buffermanagement and timer management.The issue in buffer management is avoidingunnecessary copying, as mentioned above.Timer management is also importantbecause nearly all timers set do not expire. Theyare set to guard against segmentloss, but most segments and their acknowledgements arrive correctly.Hence, it isimportant to optimize timer management for the case of timers rarely expiring.Acommon scheme is to use a linked list of timer events sorted by expirationtime. Thehead entry contains a counter telling howmanyticks awayfrom expiryit is.Each successive entry contains a counter telling howmanyticks after the pre-vious entry it is.Thus, if timers expire in 3, 10, and 12 ticks, respectively,the threecounters are 3, 7, and 2, respectively.At every clock tick, the counter in the head entry is decremented.When it hitszero, its event is processed and the next item on the list becomes the head.Itscounter does not have tobechanged. Thisway, inserting and deleting timers areexpensive operations, with execution times proportional to the length of the list.Amuch more efficient approach can be used if the maximum timer interval isbounded and known in advance. Here,an array called atiming wheelcan be used,as shown in Fig.6-54. Eachslot corresponds to one clock tick.The current timeshown isT= 4. Timers are scheduled to expire at 3, 10, and 12 ticks from now. Ifanew timer suddenly is set to expire in seventicks, an entry is just made in slot 11.Similarly,ifthe timer set forT+ 10 has to be canceled, the list starting in slot 14has to be searched and the required entry removed. Notethat the array of Fig.6-54cannot accommodate timers beyondT+ 15.When the clock ticks, the current time pointer is advanced by one slot (circu-larly). Ifthe entry nowpointed to is nonzero, all of its timers are processed.Manyvariations on the basic idea are discussed by Varghese and Lauck (1987).'),\n",

Reducing software overhead can help mobile computers run moreefficiently,but it does nothing to improve performance when the network links arethe bottleneck.To use bandwidth well, protocol headers and payloads should be carried withthe minimum of bits. For payloads, this means using compact encodings of infor-mation, such as images that are in JPEG format rather than a bitmap, or documentformats such as PDF that include compression. It also means application-levelcaching mechanisms, such as Web caches that reduce transfers in the first place.What about for protocol headers?At the link layer,headers for wireless net-works are typically compact because theywere designed with scarce bandwidth inmind. For example, packets in connection-oriented networks have short con-nection identifiers instead of longer addresses. However, higher layer protocolssuch as IP,TCP and UDP come in one version for all link layers, and theyare notdesigned with compact headers. In fact, streamlined processing to reduce softwareoverhead often leads to headers that are not as compact as theycould otherwise be(e.g., IPv6 has a more loosely packed headers than IPv4).The higher-layer headers can be a significant performance hit.Consider,forexample, voice-over-IP data that is being carried with the combination of IP,UDP,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 625}, page_content='602 THE TRANSPORTLAYER CHAP.6and RTP.These protocols require 40 bytes of header (20 for IPv4, 8 for UDP,and12 for RTP). With IPv6 the situation is evenworse: 60 bytes, including the 40-byteIPv6 header.The headers can wind up as the majority of the transmitted data andconsume more than half the bandwidth.Header compressionis used to reduce the bandwidth taken overlinks byhigher-layer protocol headers. Specially designed schemes are used instead of gen-eral purpose methods. This is because headers are short, so theydonot compresswell individually,and decompression requires all prior data to be received. Thiswill not be the case if a packet is lost.Header compression obtains large gains by using knowledge of the protocolformat. One of the first schemes was designed by Van Jacobson (1990) for com-pressing TCP/IP headers overslowserial links. It is able to compress a typicalTCP/IP header of 40 bytes down to an average of 3 bytes.The trick to this methodis hinted at in Fig.6-53. Manyofthe header fields do not change from packet topacket. There is no need, for example, to send the same IP TTL or the same TCPport numbers in each and every packet. Theycan be omitted on the sending side ofthe link and filled in on the receiving side.Similarly,other fields change in a predictable manner.For example, barringloss, the TCP sequence number advances with the data. In these cases, the receivercan predict the likely value. The actual number only needs to be carried when itdiffers from what is expected. Even then, it may be carried as a small change fromthe previous value, as when the acknowledgement number increases when newdata is receivedinthe reverse direction.With header compression, it is possible to have simple headers in higher-layerprotocols and compact encodings overlow bandwidth links.ROHC(RObustHeader Compression)isamodern version of header compression that is definedas a framework in RFC 5795.It is designed to tolerate the loss that can occur onwireless links.There is a profile for each set of protocols to be compressed, suchas IP/UDP/RTP.Compressed headers are carried by referring to a context, whichis essentially a connection; header fields may easily be predicted for packets of thesame connection, but not for packets of different connections. In typical operation,ROHC reduces IP/UDP/RTP headers from 40 bytes to 1 to 3 bytes.While header compression is mainly targeted at reducing bandwidth needs, itcan also be useful for reducing delay.Delay is comprised of propagation delay,which is fixed givenanetwork path, and transmission delay,which depends on thebandwidth and amount of data to be sent.Forexample, a 1-Mbps link sends 1 bitin 1µ sec. Inthe case of media overwireless networks, the network is relativelyslowsotransmission delay may be an important factor in overall delay and consis-tently lowdelay is important for quality of service.Header compression can help by reducing the amount of data that is sent, andhence reducing transmission delay.The same effect can be achievedbysendingsmaller packets. Thiswill trade increased software overhead for decreased trans-mission delay.Note that another potential source of delay is queueing delay to'),\n",

This can also be significant because wireless links areoften heavily used as the limited resource in a network. In this case, the wirelesslink must have quality-of-service mechanisms that give low delay to real-timepackets. Header compression alone is not sufficient.6.7.8 Protocols for Long Fat NetworksSince the 1990s, there have been gigabit networks that transmit data overlargedistances. Because of the combination of a fast network, or ‘‘fat pipe,’’ and longdelay,these networks are calledlong fat networks.When these networks arose,people’sfirst reaction was to use the existing protocols on them, but various prob-lems quickly arose.In this section, we will discuss some of the problems withscaling up the speed and delay of network protocols.The first problem is that manyprotocols use 32-bit sequence numbers.Whenthe Internet began, the lines between routers were mostly 56-kbps leased lines, so ahost blasting awayatfull speed took over1week to cycle through the sequencenumbers. Tothe TCP designers, 232wasapretty decent approximation of infinitybecause there was little danger of old packets still being around a week after theywere transmitted.With 10-Mbps Ethernet, the wrap time became 57 minutes,much shorter,but still manageable.With a 1-Gbps Ethernet pouring data out ontothe Internet, the wrap time is about 34 sec., well under the 120-sec maximum pack-et lifetime on the Internet.All of a sudden, 232is not nearly as good an approxi-mation to infinity since a fast sender can cycle through the sequence space whileold packets still exist.The problem is that manyprotocol designers simply assumed, without statingit, that the time required to use up the entire sequence space would greatly exceedthe maximum packet lifetime.Consequently,there was no need to evenworryabout the problem of old duplicates still existing when the sequence numberswrapped around.At gigabit speeds, that unstated assumption fails. Fortunately,itprovedpossible to extend the effective sequence number by treating the timestampthat can be carried as an option in the TCP header of each packet as the high-orderbits. Thismechanism is called PAWS, as described earlier.Asecond problem is that the size of the flowcontrol windowmust be greatlyincreased. Consider,for example, sending a 64-KB burst of data from San Diegoto Boston in order to fill the receiver’s64-KB buffer.Suppose that the link is 1Gbps and the one-way speed-of-light-in-fiber delay is 20 msec.Initially,att= 0,the pipe is empty,asillustrated in Fig.6-55(a). Only500µ sec later,inFig. 6-55(b),all the segments are out on the fiber.The lead segment will nowbesomewhere in the vicinity of Brawley, still deep in Southern California.However,the transmitter must stop until it gets a windowupdate.After 20 msec, the lead segment hits Boston, as shown in Fig.6-55(c), and isacknowledged. Finally,40msec after starting, the first acknowledgement getsback to the sender and the second burst can be transmitted.Since the transmission'),\n",

Clearly,this is a massive waste of resources. More complexprotocols such as selective-repeat are needed.Afourth problem is that gigabit lines are fundamentally different from megabitlines in that long gigabit lines are delay limited rather than bandwidth limited.InFig. 6-56we showthe time it takes to transfer a 1-Mbit file 4000 km at varioustransmission speeds.At speeds up to 1 Mbps, the transmission time is dominatedby the rate at which the bits can be sent.By 1 Gbps, the 40-msec round-trip delaydominates the 1 msec it takes to put the bits on the fiber.Further increases inbandwidth have hardly anyeffect at all.1000 sec100 sec10 sec1 sec100 msec10 msec1 msec File transfer time\\nData rate (bps)103104105106107108109101010111012\\nFigure6-56.Time to transfer and acknowledge a 1-Mbit file overa4000-kmline.Figure 6-56 has unfortunate implications for network protocols.It says thatstop-and-wait protocols, such as RPC, have aninherent upper bound on their per-formance.

Comparethese numbers to1000-MIPS computers exchanging packets overa1-Gbps line.The number ofinstructions per byte has decreased by more than a factor of 10.The exact num-bers are debatable depending on dates and scenarios, but the conclusion is this:there is less time available for protocol processing than there used to be, so proto-cols must become simpler.Let us nowturn from the problems to ways of dealing with them.The basicprinciple that all high-speed network designers should learn by heart is:Design for speed, not for bandwidth optimization.Old protocols were often designed to minimize the number of bits on the wire, fre-quently by using small fields and packing them together into bytes and words.This concern is still valid for wireless networks, but not for gigabit networks. Pro-tocol processing is the problem, so protocols should be designed to minimize it.The IPv6 designers clearly understood this principle.Atempting way to go fast is to build fast network interfaces in hardware. Thedifficulty with this strategy is that unless the protocol is exceedingly simple, hard-ware just means a plug-in board with a second CPU and its own program.Tomakesure the network coprocessor is cheaper than the main CPU, it is often aslower chip.The consequence of this design is that much of the time the main(fast) CPU is idle waiting for the second (slow) CPU to do the critical work. Itis amyth to think that the main CPU has other work to do while waiting. Furthermore,when twogeneral-purpose CPUs communicate, race conditions can occur,soelab-orate protocols are needed between the twoprocessors to synchronize them cor-rectly and avoid races.Usually,the best approach is to makethe protocols simpleand have the main CPU do the work.Packet layout is an important consideration in gigabit networks. Theheadershould contain as fewfields as possible, to reduce processing time, and these fieldsshould be big enough to do the job and be word-aligned for fast processing.In thiscontext, ‘‘big enough’’means that problems such as sequence numbers wrappingaround while old packets still exist, receivers being unable to advertise enoughwindowspace because the windowfield is too small, etc.do not occur.The maximum data size should be large, to reduce software overhead and per-mit efficient operation.Forhigh-speed networks, 1500 bytes is too small, which iswhygigabit Ethernet supports jumbo frames of up to 9 KB and IPv6 supports jum-bogram packets in excess of 64 KB.Let us nowlook at the issue of feedback in high-speed protocols.Due to the(relatively) long delay loop, feedback should be avoided if at all possible: it takestoo long for the receivertosignal the sender.One example of feedback is govern-ing the transmission rate by using a sliding windowprotocol. Futureprotocolsmay switch to rate-based protocols to avoid the (long) delays inherent in the re-ceiversending windowupdates to the sender.Insuch a protocol, the sender can'),\n",

Itisaccessed through serviceprimitivesthat permit the establishment, use, and release of connections.Acom-mon transport layer interface is the one provided by Berkeleysockets.Transport protocols must be able to do connection management overunreliablenetworks. Connectionestablishment is complicated by the existence of delayedduplicate packets that can reappear at inopportune moments.To deal with them,three-way handshakes are needed to establish connections.Releasing a connectionis easier than establishing one but is still far from trivial due to the two-army prob-lem.Even when the network layer is completely reliable, the transport layer hasplenty of work to do.It must handle all the service primitives, manage connectionsand timers, allocate bandwidth with congestion control, and run a variable-sizedsliding windowfor flowcontrol.Congestion control should allocate all of the available bandwidth betweencompeting flows fairly,and it should track changes in the usage of the network.The AIMD control lawconverges to a fair and efficient allocation.The Internet has twomain transport protocols: UDP and TCP.UDP is a con-nectionless protocol that is mainly a wrapper for IP packets with the additional fea-ture of multiplexing and demultiplexing multiple processes using a single IPaddress. UDPcan be used for client-server interactions, for example, using RPC.It can also be used for building real-time protocols such as RTP.The main Internet transport protocol is TCP.Itprovides a reliable, bidirec-tional, congestion-controlled byte stream with a 20-byte header on all segments. Agreat deal of work has gone into optimizing TCP performance, using algorithmsfrom Nagle, Clark, Jacobson, Karn, and others.'),\n",

Specifically,manymodern Web sites host their con-tent on multiple machines, often geographically distributed clusters. The organiza-tion hosting the content may wish to ‘‘move’’ a client’scommunication from oneWebserver to another.The DNS is typically the most convenient way to do this.High-level, readable names decouple machine names from machine addresses.An organization’sWeb server could thus be referred to aswww.cs.uchicago.edu,regardless of its IP address.Because the devices along a network path forwardtraffictoits destination based on IP address, these human-readable domain namesmust be converted to IP addresses; theDNS(Domain Name System)isthe mech-anism that does so. In the subsequent sections, we will study howDNS performsthis mapping, as well as howithas evolved overthe past decades.In particular,one of the most significant developments in the DNS in recent years is its implica-tions for user privacy.Wewill explore these implications and various recent devel-opments in DNS encryption that are related to privacy.7.1.1 Historyand OverviewBack in the ARPANET days, a file,hosts.txt,listed all the computer names andtheir IP addresses.Every night, all of the hosts would fetch it from the site atwhich it was maintained.Foranetwork of a fewhundred large timesharingmachines, this approach worked reasonably well.However, well before manymillions of PCs were connected to the Internet,everyone involved with it realized that this approach could not continue to workforever. For one thing, the size of the file would become too large. Even moreimportantly,host name conflicts would occur constantly unless names were cent-rally managed, something unthinkable in a huge international network due to theload and latency. The Domain Name System was invented in 1983 to address theseproblems, and it has been a key part of the Internet eversince.DNS is a hierarchical naming scheme and a distributed database system thatimplements this naming scheme.It is primarily used for mapping host names to IPaddresses, but it has several other purposes, which we will outline in more detailbelow. DNS is one of the most actively evolving protocols in the Internet.DNS isdefined in RFC 1034, RFC 1035, RFC 2181, and further elaborated in manyotherRFCs.7.1.2 TheDNS Lookup ProcessDNS operates as follows. Tomap a name onto an IP address, an applicationprogram calls a library procedure, (typicallygethostbynameor the equivalent) pas-sing this function the name as a parameter.This process is sometimes referred toas thestub resolver.The stub resolver sends a query containing the name to alocal DNS resolver,often called thelocal recursive resolveror simply thelocal'),\n",

Thelocal recursive resolver ultimately returns aresponse with the corresponding IP address to the stub resolver,which then passesthe result to the function that issued the query in the first place.The query andresponse messages are sent as UDP packets. Givenknowledge of the IP address,the program can then communicate with the host corresponding to the DNS namethat it had looked up.We will explore this process in more detail later in this chap-ter.Typically,the stub resolver issues a recursive lookup to the local resolver,meaning that it simply issues the query and waits for the response from the localresolver.The local resolver,onthe other hand, issues a sequence of queries to therespective name servers for each part of the name hierarchy; the name server that isresponsible for a particular part of the hierarchyisoften called theauthoritativename serverfor that domain.As we will see later,DNS uses caching, but cachescan be out of date.The authoritative name server is, well, authoritative.Itisbydefinition always correct.Before describing more detailed operation of DNS, wedescribe the DNS name server hierarchyand hownames are allocated.When a host’sstub resolver sends a query to the local resolver,the localresolver handles the resolution until it has the desired answer,ornoanswer.Itdoesnotreturn partial answers.On the other hand, the root name server (and eachsubsequent name server) does not recursively continue the query for the local nameserver.Itjust returns a partial answer and movesontothe next query.The localresolver is responsible for continuing the resolution by issuing further iterativequeries.The name resolution process typically involves both mechanisms.Arecursivequery may always seem preferable, but manyname servers (especially the root)will not handle them.Theyare too busy.Iterative queries put the burden on theoriginator.The rationale for the local name server supporting a recursive query isthat it is providing a service to hosts in its domain. Those hosts do not have tobeconfigured to run a full name server,just to reach the local one.A16-bit tran-saction identifier is included in each query and copied to the response so that aname server can match answers to the corresponding query,evenifmultiplequeries are outstanding at the same time.All of the answers, including all the partial answers returned, are cached.Inthis way,ifacomputer atcs.vu.nlqueries forcs.uchicago.edu,the answer iscached. Ifshortly thereafter,another host atcs.vu.nlalso queriescs.uchicago.edu,the answer will already be known. Even better,ifahost queries for a different hostin the same domain, saynoise.cs.uchicago.edu,the query can be sent directly tothe authoritative name server forcs.uchicago.edu.Similarly,queries for otherdomains inuchicago.educan start directly from theuchicago.eduname server.Using cached answers greatly reduces the steps in a query and improvesper-formance.

Ifacertain machine has had the same IP address for years, it may be safeto cache that information for one day.For more volatile information, it might besafer to purge the records after a fewseconds or a minute.DNS queries have a simple format that includes various information, includingthe name being queried (QNAME), as well as other auxiliary information, such asatransaction identifier; the transaction identifier is often used to map queries toresponses. Initially,the transaction ID was only 16 bits, and the queries and re-sponses were not secured; this design choice left DNS vulnerable to a variety ofattacks including something called a cache poisoning attack, whose details we dis-cuss further in Chap. 8. When performing a series of iterative lookups, a recursiveDNS resolver might send the entire QNAME to the sequence of authoritative nameservers returning the responses. At some point, protocol designers pointed out thatsending the entire QNAME to every authoritative name server in a sequence of it-erative resolvers constituted a privacy risk. As a result, manyrecursive resolversnowuse a process calledQNAME minimization,whereby the local resolver onlysends the part of the query that the respective authoritative name server has theinformation to resolve. For example, with QNAME minimization, givenaname toresolvesuch aswww.cs.uchicago.edu,alocal resolver would send only the stringcs.uchicago.eduto the authoritative name server foruchicago.edu,asopposed tothe fully qualified domain name (FQDN), to avoid revealing the entire FQDN tothe authoritative name server.For more information on QNAME minimization, seeRFC 7816.Until very recently,DNS queries and responses relied on UDP as its transportprotocol, based on the rationale that DNS queries and responses needed to be fastand lightweight, and could not handle the corresponding overhead of a TCP three-wayhandshake. However, various developments, including the resulting insecurityof the DNS protocol and the myriad subsequent attacks that DNS has been subjectto, ranging from cache poisoning to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks,has resulted in an increasing trend towards the use of TCP as the transport protocolfor DNS. Using TCP as the transport protocol for DNS has subsequently allowedDNS to leverage modern secure transport and application-layer protocols, resultingin DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH). Wediscuss these develop-ments in more detail later in this chapter.If the DNS stub resolver does not receive a response within some relativelyshort period of time (a timeout period), the DNS client repeats the query,tryinganother server for the domain after a small number of retries.This process isdesigned to handle the case of the server being down as well as the query orresponse packet getting lost.'),\n",

Thus,the engineeringdepartment at Cisco might beeng.cisco.com.,rather than a UNIX-style name suchas/com/cisco/eng.Notice that this hierarchical naming means thateng.cisco.com.does not conflict with a potential use ofengineng.uchicago.edu.,which might beused by the English department at the University of Chicago.Domain names can be either absolute or relative.Anabsolute domain namealways ends with a period (e.g.,eng.cisco.com.), whereas a relative one does not.Relative names have tobeinterpreted in some context to uniquely determine theirtrue meaning.In both cases, a named domain refers to a specific node in the treeand all the nodes under it.Domain names are case-insensitive,soedu,Edu,andEDUmean the samething. Componentnames can be up to 63 characters long, and full path namesmust not exceed 255 characters. The fact that DNS in case insensitive has beenused to defend against various DNS attacks, including DNS cache poisoningattacks, using a technique called 0x20 encoding (Dagon et al., 2008), which wewill discuss in more detail later in this chapter.In principle, domains can be inserted into the hierarchyineither the generic orthe country domains.Forexample, the domaincc.gatech.educould equally wellbe (and are often) listed under theuscountry domain ascc.gt.atl.ga.us.Inprac-tice, however, most organizations in the United States are under generic domains,'),\n",

Inthisway, name conflicts are avoided and each domain can keep track of all its subdo-mains. Onceanew domain has been created and registered, it can create subdo-mains, such ascs.unsd.edu,without getting permission from anybody higher up thetree.Naming follows organizational boundaries, not physical networks. For exam-ple, if the computer science and electrical engineering departments are located inthe same building and share the same LAN, theycan nevertheless have distinctdomains. Similarly,evenifcomputer science is split overBabbage Hall and Tur-ing Hall, the hosts in both buildings will normally belong to the same domain.7.1.4 DNSQueries and ResponsesWe now turn to the structure, format, and purpose of DNS queries, and howtheDNS servers answer those queries.DNS QueriesAs previously discussed, a DNS client typically issues a query to a local recur-sive resolver,which performs an iterative query to ultimately resolvethe query.The most common query type is anArecord query,which asks for a mapping fromadomain name to an IP address for a corresponding Internet endpoint. DNS has arange of other resource records (with corresponding queries), as we discuss furtherin the next section on resource records (i.e., responses).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 644}, page_content='SEC. 7.1 THE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) 621Although the primary mechanism for DNS has long been to map human read-able names to IP addresses, overthe years, DNS queries have been used for a var-iety of other purposes. Another common use for DNS queries is to look up do-mains in aDNSBL(DNS-based blacklist), which are lists that are commonlymaintained to keep track of IP addresses associated with spammers and malware.To look up a domain name in a DNSBL, a client might send a DNS A-record queryto a special DNS server,such aspbl.spamhaus.org(a ‘‘policyblacklist’’), whichcorresponds to a list of IP addresses that are not supposed to be making connec-tions to mail servers. Tolook up a particular IP address, a client simply reversesthe octets for the IP address and prepends the result topbl.spamhaus.org.Forexample, to look up 127.0.0.2, a client would simply issue a query for2.0.0.127.pbl.spamhaus.org.Ifthe corresponding IP address was in the list, theDNS query would return an IP address that typically encodes some additional in-formation, such as the provenance of that entry in the list. If the IP address is notcontained in the list, the DNS server would indicate that by responding with thecorresponding NXDOMAIN response, corresponding to ‘‘no such domain.’’Extensions and Enhancements to DNS QueriesDNS queries have become more sophisticated and complexovertime, as theneeds to serveclients with increasingly specific and relevant information overtimehas increased, and as security concerns have grown. Two significant extensions toDNS queries in recent years has been the use of theEDNS0 CS Extended DNSClient Subnetor simplyEDNS Client Subnetoption, whereby a client’slocalrecursive resolver passes the IP address subnet of the stub resolver to the authorita-tive name server.The EDNS0 CS mechanism allows the authoritative name server for a domainname to knowthe IP address of the client that initially performed the query.Know-ing this information can typically allowanauthoritative DNS server to perform amore effective mapping to a nearby copyofareplicated service. For example, if aclient issues a query for google.com, the authoritative name server for Googlewould typically want to return a name that corresponds to a front-end server that isclose to the client. The ability to do so of course depends on knowing where on thenetwork (and, ideally,where in the world, geographically) the client is located.Ordinarily,anauthoritative name server might only see the IP address of the localrecursive resolver.If the client that initiated the query happens to be located near its respectivelocal resolver,then the authoritative server for that domain could determine anappropriate client mapping simply from the location of the DNS local recursive.Increasingly,however, clients have begun to use local recursive resolvers that mayhave IPaddresses that makeitdifficult to locate the client. For example, Googleand Cloudflare both operate public DNS resolvers (8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1, respec-tively). If a client is configured to use one of these local recursive resolvers, then'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 645}, page_content='622 THE APPLICATION LAYER CHAP.7the authoritative name server does not learn much useful information from the IPaddress of the recursive resolver.EDNS0 CS solves this problem by including theIP subnet in the query from the local recursive,sothat the authoritative can see theIP subnet of the client that initiated the query.As previously noted, the names in DNS queries are not case sensitive.Thischaracteristic has allowed modern DNS resolvers to include additional bits of atransaction ID in the query by setting each character in a QNAME to an arbitrarycase. A 16-bit transaction ID is vulnerable to various cache poisoning attacks,including the Kaminskyattack described in Chap. 8. This vulnerability partiallyarises because the DNS transaction ID is only 16 bits.Increasing the number ofbits in the transaction ID would require changing the DNS protocol specification,which is a massive undertaking.An alternative was developed, usually called0x20 encoding,whereby a localrecursive would toggle the case on each QNAME (e.g.,uchicago.edumightbecomeuCHicaGO.EDuor similar), allowing each letter in the domain name toencode an additional bit for the DNS transaction ID. The catch, of course, is thatno other resolver should alter the case of the QNAME in subsequent iterativequeries or responses. If the casing is preserved, then the corresponding reply con-tains the QNAME with the original casing indicated by the local recursive resolver,effectively acting adding bits to the transaction identifier.The whole thing is anugly hack, but such is the nature of trying to change widely deployed softwarewhile maintaining backward compatibility.DNS Responses and Resource RecordsEvery domain, whether it is a single host or a top-leveldomain, can have a setofresource recordsassociated with it. These records are the DNS database.Forasingle host, the most common resource record is just its IP address, but manyotherkinds of resource records also exist. Whenaresolver givesadomain name toDNS, what it gets back are the resource records associated with that name.Thus,the primary function of DNS is to map domain names onto resource records.Aresource record is a five-tuple. Althoughresource records are encoded inbinary,inmost expositions resource records are presented as ASCII text, with oneline per resource record, as follows:Domainname TimetoliveClass Type ValueTheDomainnametells the domain to which this record applies.Normally,manyrecords exist for each domain, and each copyofthe database holds informationabout multiple domains.This field is thus the primary search key used to satisfyqueries. Theorder of the records in the database is not significant.TheTimetolivefield givesanindication of howstable the record is.Infor-mation that is highly stable is assigned a large value, such as 86400 (the number ofseconds in 1 day).Information that is volatile (likestock prices), or that operators'),\n",

In the case of a geographically distributed service, a resolver mayreturn to its client one or more IP addresses of a server that is close to the client(geographically or topologically), to improve performance, and for load balancing.An important record type is theNSrecord.

DNSSEC records allowresponses from DNS name servers tocarry digital signatures, which the local or stub resolver can subsequently verify toensure that the DNS records were not modified or tampered with.Each DNS ser-vercomputes a hash (a kind of long checksum) of theRRSET(Resource RecordSet)for each set of resource records of the same type, with its private crypto-graphic keys. Correspondingpublic keyscan be used to verify the signatures onthe RRSETs.(For those not familiar with cryptography, Chap. 8 provides sometechnical background.)Verifying the signature of an RRSET with the name server’scorrespondingpublic key ofcourse requires verifying the authenticity of that server’spublic key.This verification can be accomplished if the public key ofone authoritative nameserver’spublic key issigned by the parent name server in the name hierarchy. Forexample, the.eduauthoritative name server might sign the public key correspond-ing to the chicago.edu authoritative name server,and so forth.DNSSEC has tworesource records relating to public keys: (1) the RRSIGrecord, which corresponds to a signature overthe RRSET,signed with the corres-ponding authoritative name server’sprivate key,and (2) the DNSKEY record,which is the public key for the corresponding RRSET,which is signed by the par-ent’sprivate key.This hierarchical structure for signatures allows DNSSEC publickeys for the name server hierarchytobedistributed in band.Only the root-levelpublic keysmust be distributed out-of-band, and those keyscan be distributed inthe same way that resolvers come to knowabout the IP addresses of the root nameservers.

Theseare hosts thathold the database for the zone.Normally,azone will have one primary name ser-ver, which gets its information from a file on its disk, and one or more secondaryname servers, which get their information from the primary name server.Toimprove reliability,some of the name servers can be located outside the zone.The process of looking up a name and finding an address is calledname reso-lution.When a resolver has a query about a domain name, it passes the query to alocal name server.Ifthe domain being sought falls under the jurisdiction of thename server,such astop.cs.vu.nlfalling undercs.vu.nl,itreturns the authoritativeresource records.Anauthoritative recordis one that comes from the authoritythat manages the record and is thus always correct.Authoritative records are incontrast tocached records,which may be out of date.What happens when the domain is remote, such as whenflits.cs.vu.nlwants tofind the IP address ofcs.uchicago.eduat the University of Chicago?In this case,and if there is no cached information about the domain available locally,the nameserver begins a remote query.This query follows the process shown in Fig.7-7.Step 1 shows the query that is sent to the local name server.The query containsthe domain name sought, the type (A), and the class(IN).'),\n",

Thisis shown as step 2 in Fig.7-7. Tocontact a root server,each nameserver must have information about one or more root name servers. Thisinfor-mation is normally present in a system configuration file that is loaded into theDNS cache when the DNS server is started. It is simply a list ofNSrecords for theroot and the correspondingArecords.There are 13 root DNS servers, unimaginatively calleda.root-servers.netthroughm.root-servers.net.Each root server could logically be a single computer.However, since the entire Internet depends on the root servers, theyare powerfuland heavily replicated computers. Most of the servers are present in multiple geo-graphical locations and reached using anycast routing, in which a packet is deliv-ered to the nearest instance of a destination address; we described anycast inChap. 5.The replication improvesreliability and performance.The root name server is very unlikely to knowthe address of a machine atuchicago.edu,and probably does not knowthe name server foruchicago.edueith-er.But it must knowthe name server for theedudomain, in whichcs.uchicago.eduis located.It returns the name and IP address for that part of the answer in step 3.The local name server then continues its quest. It sends the entire query to theeduname server (a.edu-servers.net). Thatname server returns the name server foruchicago.edu.This is shown in steps 4 and 5. Closer now, the local name serversends the query to theuchicago.eduname server (step 6). If the domain namebeing sought was in the English department, the answer would be found, as theuchicago.eduzone includes the English department.

Mostorganizations will have multiple name ser-vers in case one is down. Half a dozen is not unusual.If you have access to aUNIX, Linux, or MacOS system, try experimenting with thedigprogram to seewhat it can do. You can learn a lot about DNS from using it.(Thedigprogram isalso available for Windows, but you may have toinstall it yourself.)Even though its purpose is simple, it should be clear that DNS is a large andcomplexdistributed system that is comprised of millions of name servers that worktogether.Itforms a key link between human-readable domain names and the IPaddresses of machines.It includes replication and caching for performance andreliability and is designed to be highly robust.Some applications need to use names in more flexible ways, for example, bynaming content and resolving to the IP address of a nearby host that has the con-tent. This fits the model of searching for and downloading a movie. Itis the moviethat matters, not the computer that has a copyofit, so all that is wanted is the IPaddress ofanynearby computer that has a copyofthe movie. Contentdeliverynetworks are one way to accomplish this mapping.We will describe howtheybuild on the DNS later in this chapter,inSec. 7.5.7.1.7 DNSPrivacyHistorically,DNS queries and responses have not been encrypted. As a result,anyother device or eavesdropper on the network (e.g., other devices, a systemadministrator,acoffee shop network) could conceivably observeauser’sDNS traf-ficand determine information about that user.For example, a lookup to a site likeuchicago.edumight indicate that a user was browsing the University of ChicagoWebsite. While such information might seem innocuous, DNS lookups to Websites such aswebmd.commight indicate that a user was performing medicalresearch. Combinations of lookups combined with other information can oftenevenreveal more specific information, possibly eventhe precise Web site that auser is visiting.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 653}, page_content='630 THE APPLICATION LAYER CHAP.7Privacy issues associated with DNS queries have become more contentiouswhen considering emerging applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) andsmart homes. For example, the DNS queries that a device issues can reveal infor-mation about the type of devices that users have intheir smart homes and theextent to which theyare interacting with those devices. For example, the DNSqueries that an Internet-connected camera or sleep monitor issues can uniquelyidentify the device (Apthorpe et al., 2019). Giventhe increasingly sensitive activi-ties that people perform on Internet-connected devices, from browsers to Inter-net-connected ‘‘smart’’devices, there is an increasing desire to encrypt DNSqueries and responses.Several recent developments are poised to potentially reshape DNS entirely.The first is the movement toward encrypting DNS queries and responses.Variousorganizations, including Cloudflare, Google, and others are nowoffering users theopportunity to direct their DNS traffictotheir own local recursive resolvers, andadditionally offering support for encrypted transport (e.g., TLS, HTTPS) betweenthe DNS stub resolver and their local resolver.Insome cases, these organizationsare partnering with Web browser manufacturers (e.g., Mozilla) to potentially directall DNS traffictothese local resolvers by default.If all DNS queries and responses are exchanged with cloud providers overencrypted transport by default, the implications for the future of the Internet archi-tecture could be extremely significant. Specifically,Internet service providers willno longer have the ability to observeDNS queries from their subscribers’ homenetworks, which has, in the past, been one of the primary ways that ISPs monitorthese networks for infections and malware (Antonakakis et al., 2010). Other func-tions, such as parental controls and various other services that ISPs offer,alsodepend on seeing DNS traffic.Ultimately,two somewhat orthogonal issues are at play.The first is the shift ofDNS towards encrypted transport, which almost everyone would agree is a positivechange (there were initial concerns about performance, which have mostly nowbeen addressed). The second issue is thornier: it involves who gets to operate thelocal recursive resolvers. Previously,the local recursive resolver was generallyoperated by a user’sISP; if DNS resolution movestothe browser,however, viaDoH, then the browsers (the twomost popular of which are at this point largelycontrolled by a single dominant provider,Google) can control who is in a positionto observeDNS traffic. Ultimately,the operator of the local recursive resolver cansee the DNS queries from the user and associate those with an IP address; whetherthe user wants their ISP or a large advertising companytosee their DNS trafficshould be their choice, but the default settings in the browser may ultimately deter-mine who ends up seeing the majority of this traffic. Presently,awide range oforganizations, from ISPs to content providers and advertising companies are tryingto establish what are being calledTRRs(Trusted Recursive Resolvers), whichare local recursive resolvers that use DoT or DoH to resolvequeries for clients.Time will tell howthese developments ultimately reshape the DNS architecture.'),\n",

Faster and cheaper than paper mail, email has been a popular applicationsince the early days of the Internet. Before 1990, it was mostly used in academia.During the 1990s, it became known to the public at large and grewexponentially,to the point where the number of emails sent per day nowisvastly more than thenumber ofsnail mail(i.e., paper) letters. Other forms of network communication,such as instant messaging and voice-over-IP calls have expanded greatly in useoverthe past decade, but email remains the workhorse of Internet communication.It is widely used within industry for intracompanycommunication, for example, toallowfar-flung employees all overthe world to cooperate on complexprojects.Unfortunately,likepaper mail, the majority of email—some 9 out of 10 mes-sages—is junk mail orspam.While mail systems can remove much of it now-adays, a lot still gets through and research into detecting it all is ongoing, forexample, see Dan et al. (2019) and Zhang et al. (2019).Email, likemost other forms of communication, has developed its own conven-tions and styles.It is very informal and has a lowthreshold of use.People whowould neverdream of calling up or evenwriting a letter to a Very Important Persondo not hesitate for a second to send a sloppily written email to him or her.Byeliminating most cues associated with rank, age, and gender,email debates oftenfocus on content, not status.With email, a brilliant idea from a summer studentcan have more impact than a dumb one from an executive vice president.Email is full of jargon such as BTW (By The Way), ROTFL (Rolling On TheFloor Laughing), and IMHO (In My Humble Opinion).Manypeople also use littleASCII symbols calledsmileys,starting with the ubiquitous ‘‘:-)’’.

The firstemail systems simply consisted of file transfer protocols, with the convention thatthe first line of each message (i.e., file) contained the recipient’saddress. Astimewent on, email diverged from file transfer and manyfeatures were added, such asthe ability to send one message to a list of recipients. Multimedia capabilitiesbecame important in the 1990s to send messages with images and other non-textmaterial. Programs for reading email became much more sophisticated too, shift-ing from text-based to graphical user interfaces and adding the ability for users toaccess their mail from their laptops wherevertheyhappen to be. Finally,with theprevalence of spam, email systems nowpay attention to finding and removingunwanted email.In our description of email, we will focus on the way that mail messages aremovedbetween users, rather than the look and feel of mail reader programs.Nevertheless, after describing the overall architecture, we will begin with the user-facing part of the email system, as it is familiar to most readers.7.2.1 Architectureand ServicesIn this section, we will provide an overviewofhow email systems areorganized and what theycan do. The architecture of the email system is shown inFig. 7-9.It consists of twokinds of subsystems: theuser agents,which allowpeo-ple to read and send email, and themessage transfer agents,which move the mes-sages from the source to the destination.We will also refer to message transferagents informally asmail servers.\\nMessageTransfer AgentMessageTransfer AgentSMTPSenderUser Agent\\nMailbox\\nReceiverUser Agent\\nEmail\\n1: Mailsubmission2: Messagetransfer 3: FinaldeliveryFigure7-9.Architecture of the email system.The user agent is a program that provides a graphical interface, or sometimes atext- and command-based interface that lets users interact with the email system.Itincludes a means to compose messages and replies to messages, display incomingmessages, and organize messages by filing, searching, and discarding them. Theact of sending newmessages into the mail system is calledmail submission.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 657}, page_content='634 THE APPLICATION LAYER CHAP.7Some of the user agent processing may be done automatically,anticipatingwhat the user wants. For example, incoming mail may be filtered to extract ordeprioritize messages that are likely spam.Some user agents include advancedfeatures, such as arranging for automatic email responses (‘‘I’m having a wonder-ful vacation and it will be a while before I get back to you.’’). Auser agent runs onthe same computer on which a user reads her mail. It is just another program andmay be run only some of the time.The message transfer agents are typically system processes. Theyrun in thebackground on mail server machines and are intended to be always available.Their job is to automatically move email through the system from the originator tothe recipient with SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), discussed in Sec. 7.2.4.This is the message transfer step.SMTP was originally specified as RFC 821 and revised to become the currentRFC 5321.It sends mail overconnections and reports back the delivery status andanyerrors. Numerousapplications exist in which confirmation of delivery isimportant and may evenhavelegalsignificance (‘‘Well, Your Honor,myemail sys-tem is just not very reliable, so I guess the electronic subpoena just got lost some-where’’).Message transfer agents also implementmailing lists,inwhich an identicalcopyofamessage is delivered to everyone on a list of email addresses.Additionaladvanced features are carbon copies, blind carbon copies, high-priority email,secret (encrypted) email, alternative recipients if the primary one is not currentlyavailable, and the ability for assistants to read and answer their bosses’ email.Linking user agents and message transfer agents are the concepts of mailboxesand a standard format for email messages.Mailboxesstore the email that isreceivedfor a user.Theyare maintained by mail servers. User agents simply pres-ent users with a viewofthe contents of their mailboxes. Todothis, the user agentssend the mail servers commands to manipulate the mailboxes, inspecting their con-tents, deleting messages, and so on. The retrievalofmail is the final delivery (step3) in Fig.7-9. With this architecture, one user may use different user agents onmultiple computers to access one mailbox.Mail is sent between message transfer agents in a standard format. The originalformat, RFC 822, has been revised to the current RFC 5322 and extended withsupport for multimedia content and international text. Thisscheme is calledMIME. People still refer to Internet email as RFC 822, though.Akey idea in the message format is the clear distinction between theenvelopeand the contents of the envelope. Theenvelope encapsulates the message.Fur-thermore, it contains all the information needed for transporting the message, suchas the destination address, priority,and security level, all of which are distinct fromthe message itself.The message transport agents use the envelope for routing, justas the post office does.The message inside the envelope consists of twoseparate parts: theheaderandthebody.The header contains control information for the user agents.The body'),\n",

Previews may use small icons or images to describe the contents of the mes-sage. Otherpresentation processing includes reformatting messages to fit the dis-play,and translating or converting contents to more convenient formats (e.g., digi-tized speech to recognized text).After a message has been read, the user can decide what to do with it.This iscalledmessage disposition.Options include deleting the message, sending areply,forwarding the message to another user,and keeping the message for laterreference. Mostuser agents can manage one mailbox for incoming mail with mul-tiple folders for savedmail. Thefolders allowthe user to save message accordingto sender,topic, or some other category.Filing can be done automatically by the user agent as well, evenbefore theuser reads the messages. A common example is that the fields and contents of mes-sages are inspected and used, along with feedback from the user about previousmessages, to determine if a message is likely to be spam.ManyISPs and com-panies run software that labels mail as important or spam so that the user agent canfile it in the corresponding mailbox. The ISP and companyhavethe advantage ofseeing mail for manyusers and may have lists of known spammers. If hundreds ofusers have just receivedasimilar message, it is probably spam, although it couldbe a message from the CEO to all employees. Bypresorting incoming mail as‘‘probably legitimate’’and ‘‘probably spam,’’ the user agent can save users a fairamount of work separating the good stufffrom the junk.And the most popular spam? It is generated by collections of compromisedcomputers calledbotnetsand its content depends on where you live.Fakediplo-mas are common in Asia, and cheap drugs and other dubious product offers arecommon in the U.S. Unclaimed Nigerian bank accounts still abound. Pills forenlarging various body parts are common everywhere.Other filing rules can be constructed by users.Each rule specifies a conditionand an action.Forexample, a rule could say that anymessage receivedfrom theboss goes to one folder for immediate reading and anymessage from a particularmailing list goes to another folder for later reading.Several folders are shown inFig. 7-11.The most important folders are the Inbox, for incoming mail not filedelsewhere, and Junk Mail, for messages that are thought to be spam.7.2.3 MessageFormatsNowweturn from the user interface to the format of the email messages them-selves.

Theoriginal RFC 822 wasdesigned decades ago and did not clearly distinguish the envelope fields from theheader fields. Althoughit has been revised to RFC 5322, completely redoing itwasnot possible due to its widespread usage.In normal usage, the user agentbuilds a message and passes it to the message transfer agent, which then uses someof the header fields to construct the actual envelope, a somewhat old-fashionedmixing of message and envelope.The principal header fields related to message transport are listed in Fig.7-12.TheTo:field givesthe email address of the primary recipient.Having multiplerecipients is also allowed. TheCc:field givesthe addresses of anysecondaryrecipients. Interms of delivery,there is no distinction between the primary andsecondary recipients.It is entirely a psychological difference that may be impor-tant to the people involved but is not important to the mail system.The termCc:(Carbon copy) is a bit dated, since computers do not use carbon paper,but it is wellestablished.

Itis widely used for mail messages that are sent across the Internet,as well as to describe content for other applications such as Web browsing. MIMEis described in RFC 2045, and the ones following it as well as RFC 4288 and 4289.The basic idea of MIME is to continue to use the RFC 822 format but to addstructure to the message body and define encoding rules for the transfer of non-ASCII messages.Not deviating from RFC 822 allowed MIME messages to besent using the existing mail transfer agents and protocols (based on RFC 821 then,and RFC 5321 now). Allthat had to be changed were the sending and receivingprograms, which users could do for themselves.MIME defines fivenewmessage headers, as shown in Fig.7-14. Thefirst ofthese simply tells the user agent receiving the message that it is dealing with aMIME message, and which version of MIME it uses.Anymessage not containingaMIME-Version:header is assumed to be an English plaintext message (or at leastone using only ASCII characters) and is processed as such.Header MeaningMIME-Version: Identifiesthe MIME versionContent-Description:Human-readable string telling what is in the messageContent-Id: UniqueidentifierContent-Transfer-Encoding: Howthe body is wrapped for transmissionContent-Type: Type and formatof the contentFigure7-14.Message headers added by MIME.TheContent-Description:header is an ASCII string telling what is in the mes-sage.

A key problem at the time MIME was developed wasthat the mail transfer (SMTP) protocols expected ASCII messages in which no lineexceeded 1000 characters. ASCII characters use 7 bits out of each 8-bit byte. Bina-ry data such as executable programs and images use all 8 bits of each byte, as doextended character sets. There was no guarantee this data would be transferredsafely.Hence, some method of carrying binary data that made it look likearegularASCII mail message was needed. Extensions to SMTP since the development ofMIME do allow8-bit binary data to be transferred, though eventoday binary datamay not always go through the mail system correctly if unencoded.MIME provides fivetransfer encoding schemes, plus an escape to newschemes—just in case.The simplest scheme is just ASCII text messages.ASCIIcharacters use 7 bits and can be carried directly by the email protocol, providedthat no line exceeds 1000 characters.The next simplest scheme is the same thing, but using 8-bit characters, that is,all values from 0 up to and including 255 are allowed. Messagesusing the 8-bitencoding must still adhere to the standard maximum line length.Then there are messages that use a true binary encoding.These are arbitrarybinary files that not only use all 8 bits but also do not adhere to the 1000-characterline limit.Executable programs fall into this category.Nowadays, mail serverscan negotiate to send data in binary (or 8-bit) encoding, falling back to ASCII ifboth ends do not support the extension.The ASCII encoding of binary data is calledbase64 encoding.Inthis scheme,groups of 24 bits are broken up into four 6-bit units, with each unit being sent as alegalASCII character.The coding is ‘‘A’’ for 0, ‘‘B’’for 1, and so on, followed bythe 26 lowercase letters, the 10 digits, and finally + and / for 62 and 63, respec-tively.The == and = sequences indicate that the last group contained only 8 or 16bits, respectively.Carriage returns and line feeds are ignored, so theycan beinserted at will in the encoded character stream to keep the lines short enough.Arbitrary binary text can be sent safely using this scheme, albeit inefficiently.Thisencoding was very popular before binary-capable mail servers were widely deploy-ed. It is still commonly seen.The last header shown in Fig.7-14 is really the most interesting one.It speci-fies the nature of the message body and has had an impact well beyond email. Forinstance, content downloaded from the Web is labeled with MIME types so that thebrowser knows howtopresent it.So is content sent overstreaming media andreal-time transports such as voice overIP.Initially,sevenMIME types were defined in RFC 1521.Each type has one ormore available subtypes.The type and subtype are separated by a slash, as in'),\n",

Themail transfer is done with the SMTP protocol.The simplest way to move messages is to establish a transport connection fromthe source machine to the destination machine and then just transfer the message.This is howSMTP originally worked. Over the years, however, two different usesof SMTP have been differentiated. Thefirst use ismail submission,step 1 in theemail architecture of Fig.7-9. Thisis the means by which user agents send mes-sages into the mail system for delivery.The second use is to transfer messagesbetween message transfer agents (step 2 in Fig.7-9). Thissequence delivers mailall the way from the sending to the receiving message transfer agent in one hop.Final delivery is accomplished with different protocols that we will describe in thenext section.In this section, we will describe the basics of the SMTP protocol and its exten-sion mechanism.Then we will discuss howitisused differently for mail submis-sion and message transfer.'),\n",

Thisserveraccepts incoming connections, subject to some security checks, and accepts mes-sages for delivery.Ifamessage cannot be delivered, an error report containing thefirst part of the undeliverable message is returned to the sender.SMTP is a simple ASCII protocol.This is not a weakness but a feature.UsingASCII text makes protocols easy to develop, test, and debug. Theycan be testedby sending commands manually,and records of the messages are easy to read.Most application-levelInternet protocols nowwork this way (e.g., HTTP).We will walk through a simple message transfer between mail servers thatdelivers a message.After establishing the TCP connection to port 25, the sendingmachine, operating as the client, waits for the receiving machine, operating as theserver,totalk first. Theserver starts by sending a line of text giving its identityand telling whether it is prepared to receive mail. Ifit is not, the client releases theconnection and tries again later.If the server is willing to accept email, the client announces whom the email iscoming from and whom it is going to.If such a recipient exists at the destination,the server givesthe client the go-ahead to send the message.Then the client sendsthe message and the server acknowledges it.No checksums are needed becauseTCP provides a reliable byte stream.If there is more email, that is nowsent.When all the email has been exchanged in both directions, the connection isreleased. Asample dialog is shown in Fig.7-16. Thelines sent by the client (i.e.,the sender) are markedC:.Those sent by the server (i.e., the receiver) are markedS:.The first command from the client is indeed meant to beHELO.Ofthe vari-ous four-character abbreviations forHELLO,this one has numerous advantagesoverits biggest competitor.Why all the commands had to be four characters hasbeen lost in the mists of time.In Fig.7-16, the message is sent to only one recipient, so only oneRCPTcom-mand is used.Such commands are allowed to send a single message to multiplereceivers. Eachone is individually acknowledged or rejected.Even if some recipi-ents are rejected (because theydonot exist at the destination), the message can besent to the other ones.Finally,although the syntax of the four-character commands from the client isrigidly specified, the syntax of the replies is less rigid.Only the numerical codereally counts.Each implementation can put whateverstring it wants after the code.The basic SMTP works well, but it is limited in several respects.It does notinclude authentication. This means that theFROMcommand in the example couldgive any sender address that it pleases.This is quite useful for sending spam.Another limitation is that SMTP transfers ASCII messages, not binary data.

How-ever, this setting is no longer the usual case.User agents often run on laptops, home PCs, and mobile phones.Theyare notalways connected to the Internet.Mail transfer agents run on ISP and companyservers.

It is exactly what theTCP/IP protocols are designed to support.However, anISP or companyusuallydoes not want anyremote user to be able to submit messages to its mail server tobe delivered elsewhere.

This isbecause it provides a way to launder the original sender and thus makethe messagemore difficult to identify as spam.Giventhese considerations, SMTP is normally used for mail submission withtheAUTHextension. This extension lets the server check the credentials (usernameand password) of the client to confirm that the server should be providing mail ser-vice.There are several other differences in the way SMTP is used for mail submis-sion.

First, it will be sent to the mail server foralum.mit.edu.Then, it will besent to the mail server foree.uwa.edu.au.Each of these legs is a complete and sep-arate delivery as far as the mail transfer agents are concerned.7.2.5 FinalDeliveryOur mail message is almost delivered. It has arrivedatBob’smailbox. Allthatremains is to transfer a copyofthe message to Bob’suser agent for display.This isstep 3 in the architecture of Fig.7-9. This task was straightforward in the earlyInternet, when the user agent and mail transfer agent ran on the same machine asdifferent processes. The mail transfer agent simply wrote newmessages to the endof the mailbox file, and the user agent simply checked the mailbox file for newmail.Nowadays, the user agent on a PC, laptop, or mobile, is likely to be on a dif-ferent machine than the ISP or companymail server and certain to be on a differentmachine for a mail provider such as Gmail.Users want to be able to access theirmail remotely,from wherevertheyare. Theywant to access email from work,from their home PCs, from their laptops when on business trips, and from cyber-cafes when on so-called vacation. Theyalso want to be able to work offline, thenreconnect to receive incoming mail and send outgoing mail.Moreover, each usermay run several user agents depending on what computer it is convenient to use atthe moment. Several user agents may evenberunning at the same time.In this setting, the job of the user agent is to present a viewofthe contents ofthe mailbox, and to allowthe mailbox to be remotely manipulated. Several dif-ferent protocols can be used for this purpose, but SMTP is not one of them. SMTPis a push-based protocol. It takes a message and connects to a remote server totransfer the message. Final delivery cannot be achievedinthis manner bothbecause the mailbox must continue to be stored on the mail transfer agent andbecause the user agent may not be connected to the Internet at the moment thatSMTP attempts to relay messages.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 671}, page_content='648 THE APPLICATION LAYER CHAP.7IMAP—The Internet Message Access ProtocolOne of the main protocols that is used for final delivery isIMAP(InternetMessage Access Protocol). Version 4 of the protocol is defined in RFC 3501 andin its manyupdates. Touse IMAP,the mail server runs an IMAP server that listensto port 143. The user agent runs an IMAP client.The client connects to the serverand begins to issue commands from those listed in Fig. 7-18.Command DescriptionCAPABILITY Listserver capabilitiesSTARTTLS Startsecure transport(TLS; see Chap.8)LOGIN Logon to serverAUTHENTICATE Logon with other methodSELECT SelectafolderEXAMINE Selectaread-only folderCREATE CreateafolderDELETE DeleteafolderRENAME RenameafolderSUBSCRIBE Addfolder to activesetUNSUBSCRIBE Remove folder from activesetLIST Listthe available foldersLSUB Listthe activefoldersSTATUS Getthe status of a folderAPPEND Addamessage to a folderCHECK Getacheckpoint of a folderFETCH Getmessages from a folderSEARCH Findmessages in a folderSTORE Altermessage flagsCOPY Makeacopyofamessage in a folderEXPUNGE Remove messages flagged for deletionUID Issuecommands using unique identifiersNOOP DonothingCLOSE Remove flagged messages and close folderLOGOUT Logout and close connectionFigure7-18.IMAP (version 4) commands.First, the client will start a secure transport if one is to be used (in order tokeep the messages and commands confidential), and then log in or otherwiseauthenticate itself to the server.Once logged in, there are manycommands to listfolders and messages, fetch messages or evenparts of messages, mark messages'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 672}, page_content='SEC. 7.2 ELECTRONIC MAIL 649with flags for later deletion, and organize messages into folders.To avoid confu-sion, please note that we use the term ‘‘folder’’here to be consistent with the restof the material in this section, in which a user has a single mailbox made up ofmultiple folders.However, inthe IMAP specification, the termmailboxis usedinstead. One user thus has manyIMAP mailboxes, each of which is typically pres-ented to the user as a folder.IMAP has manyother features, too.It has the ability to address mail not bymessage number,but by using attributes (e.g., give methe first message fromAlice). Searches can be performed on the server to find the messages that satisfycertain criteria so that only those messages are fetched by the client.IMAP is an improvement overanearlier final delivery protocol,POP3(PostOffice Protocol, version 3), which is specified in RFC 1939.POP3 is a simplerprotocol but supports fewer features and is less secure in typical usage.Mail isusually downloaded to the user agent computer,instead of remaining on the mailserver.This makes life easier on the server,but harder on the user.Itisnot easy toread mail on multiple computers, plus if the user agent computer breaks, all emailmay be lost permanently.Nonetheless, you will still find POP3 in use.Proprietary protocols can also be used because the protocol runs between amail server and user agent that can be supplied by the same company. MicrosoftExchange is a mail system with a proprietary protocol.WebmailAn increasingly popular alternative toIMAP and SMTP for providing emailservice is to use the Web as an interface for sending and receiving mail.WidelyusedWebmailsystems include Google Gmail, Microsoft Hotmail and Yahoo!Mail. Webmail is one example of software (in this case, a mail user agent) that isprovided as a service using the Web.In this architecture, the provider runs mail servers as usual to accept messagesfor users with SMTP on port 25.However, the user agent is different. Instead ofbeing a standalone program, it is a user interface that is provided via Web pages.This means that users can use anybrowser theyliketoaccess their mail and sendnewmessages.When the user goes to the email Web page of the provider,say,Gmail, a formis presented in which the user is asked for a login name and password. Theloginname and password are sent to the server,which then validates them.If the loginis successful, the server finds the user’smailbox and builds a Web page listing thecontents of the mailbox on the fly.The Web page is then sent to the browser fordisplay.Manyofthe items on the page showing the mailbox are clickable, so messagescan be read, deleted, and so on.To makethe interface responsive,the Web pageswill often include JavaScript programs. These programs are run locally on the cli-ent in response to local events (e.g., mouse clicks) and can also download and'),\n",

The Web server takes care ofinjecting messages into the traditional mail delivery system that we have described.Forsecurity,the standard Web protocols can be used as well. These protocols con-cern themselves with encrypting Web pages, not whether the content of the Webpage is a mail message.7.3 THEWORLD WIDE WEBThe Web, as the World Wide Web is popularly known, is an architecturalframework for accessing linked content spread out overmillions of machines alloverthe Internet.In 10 years it went from being a way to coordinate the design ofhigh-energy physics experiments in Switzerland to the application that millions ofpeople think of as being ‘‘The Internet.’’ Its enormous popularity stems from thefact that it is easy for beginners to use and provides access with a rich graphicalinterface to an enormous wealth of information on almost every conceivable sub-ject, from aardvarks to Zulus.The Web beganin1989 at CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research.The initial idea was to help large teams, often with members in a dozen or morecountries and time zones, collaborate using a constantly changing collection ofreports, blueprints, drawings, photos, and other documents produced by experi-ments in particle physics. Theproposal for a Web of linked documents came fromCERN physicist Tim Berners-Lee. The first (text-based) prototype was operational18 months later.Apublic demonstration givenatthe Hypertext ’91 conferencecaught the attention of other researchers, which led Marc Andreessen at the Uni-versity of Illinois to develop the first graphical browser.Itwas called Mosaic andreleased in February 1993.The rest, as theysay,isnow history.Mosaic was so popular that a year laterAndreessen left to form a company, Netscape Communications Corp., whose goalwastodevelop Web software. For the next three years, Netscape Navigator andMicrosoft’sInternet Explorer engaged in a ‘‘browser war,’’each one trying to cap-ture a larger share of the newmarket by frantically adding more features (and thusmore bugs) than the other one.Through the 1990s and 2000s, Web sites and Web pages, as Web content iscalled, grewexponentially until there were millions of sites and billions of pages.Asmall number of these sites became tremendously popular.Those sites and thecompanies behind them largely define the Web as people experience it today.Examples include: a bookstore (Amazon, started in 1994), a flea market (eBay,1995), search (Google, 1998), and social networking (Facebook, 2004).Theperiod through 2000, when manyWeb companies became worth hundreds of mil-lions of dollars overnight, only to go bust practically the next day when theyturned'),\n",

It is called thedot com era.New ideas are stillstriking it rich on the Web.Manyofthem come from students. For example, MarkZuckerbergwas a Harvard student when he started Facebook, and SergeyBrin andLarry Page were students at Stanford when theystarted Google.Perhaps you willcome up with the next big thing.In 1994, CERN and M.I.T.signed an agreement setting up theW3C(WorldWide Web Consortium), an organization devoted to further developing the Web,standardizing protocols, and encouraging interoperability between sites.Berners-Lee became the director.Since then, several hundred universities and companieshave joined the consortium.Although there are nowmore books about the Webthan you can shakeastick at, the best place to get up-to-date information about theWebis(naturally) on the Web itself.The consortium’shome page is atwww.w3.org.Interested readers are referred there for links to pages covering all ofthe consortium’snumerous documents and activities.7.3.1 Architectural OverviewFrom the users’ point of view, the Web comprises a vast, worldwide collectionof content in the form ofWebpages.Each page typically contains links to hun-dreds of other objects, which may be hosted on anyserver on the Internet, any-where in the world. These objects may be other text and images, but nowadays alsoinclude a wide variety of objects, including advertisements and tracking scripts.Apage may alsolinkto other Web pages; users can followalink by clicking on it,which then takes them to the page pointed to.This process can be repeated indefi-nitely.The idea of having one page point to another,now calledhypertext,wasinvented by a visionary M.I.T.professor of electrical engineering, VannevarBush,in 1945 (Bush, 1945).This was long before the Internet was invented. Infact, itwasbefore commercial computers existed although several universities had pro-duced crude prototypes that filled large rooms and had millions of times less com-puting power than a smart watch but consumed more electrical power than a smallfactory.Pages are generally viewed with a program called abrowser.Brave,Chrome,Edge, Firefox, Opera, and Safari are examples of popular browsers. Thebrowserfetches the page requested, interprets the content, and displays the page, properlyformatted, on the screen.The content itself may be a mix of text, images, and for-matting commands, in the manner of a traditional document, or other forms of con-tent such as video or programs that produce a graphical interface for users.Figure 7-19 shows an example of a Web page, which contains manyobjects.In this case, the page is for the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.Thispage shows text and graphical elements (which are mostly too small to read here).Manyparts of the page include references and links to other pages. Theindexpage,which the browser loads, typically contains instructions for the browser'),\n",

On a smart-phone or tablet, the user taps the link.Following a link is simply a way of tellingthe browser to fetch another page.In the early days of the Web, links were high-lighted with underlining and colored text so that theywould stand out.Now, thecreators of Web pages can usestyle sheetsto control the appearance of manyaspects of the page, including hyperlinks, so links can effectively appear howeverthe designer of the Web site wishes.The appearance of a link can evenbedynam-ic, for example, it might change its appearance when the mouse passes overit.

Thesecure version of this protocol,which is nowthe predominant mode of retrieving content on the Web today,iscall-edHTTPS(SecureHyperText Transfer Protocol). Thecontent may simply be adocument that is read offadisk, or the result of a database query and programexecution. Thepage is astatic pageif it is a document that is the same every timeit is displayed.In contrast, if it was generated on demand by a program or containsaprogram it is adynamic page.Adynamic page may present itself differently each time it is displayed.Forexample, the front page for an electronic store may be different for each visitor.Ifabookstore customer has bought mystery novels in the past, upon visiting thestore’smain page, the customer is likely to see newthrillers prominently displayed,whereas a more culinary-minded customer might be greeted with newcookbooks.Howthe Web site keeps track of who likes what is a story to be told shortly.Butbriefly,the answer involves cookies (evenfor culinarily challenged visitors).In the browser contacts a number of servers to load the Web page.The contenton the indexpage might be loaded directly from files hosted atfcc.gov.Auxiliarycontent, such as an embedded video, might be hosted at a separate server,still atfcc.gov,but perhaps on infrastructure that is dedicated to hosting the content. Theindexpage may also contain references to other objects that the user may not evensee, such as tracking scripts, or advertisements that are hosted on third-party ser-vers. Thebrowser fetches all of these objects, scripts, and so forth and assemblesthem into a single page viewfor the user.Display entails a range of processing that depends on the kind of content.Besides rendering text and graphics, it may involveplaying a video or running ascript that presents its own user interface as part of the page. In this case, thefcc.govserver supplies the main page, thefonts.gstatic.comserver supplies addi-tional objects (e.g., fonts), and thegoogle-analytics.comserver supplies nothingthat the user can see but tracks visitors to the site.We will investigate trackers andWebprivacy later in this chapter.The Client SideLet us nowexamine the Web browser side in Fig.7-19 in more detail.Inessence, a browser is a program that can display a Web page and capture a user’srequest to ‘‘follow’’other content on the page.When an item is selected, the brow-ser follows the hyperlink and retrievesthe object that the user indicates (e.g., withamouse click, or by tapping the link on the screen of a mobile device).When the Web was first created, it was immediately apparent that having onepage point to another Web page required mechanisms for naming and locating'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 677}, page_content='654 THE APPLICATION LAYER CHAP.7pages. Inparticular,three questions had to be answered before a selected pagecould be displayed:1. Whatis the page called?2. Whereis the page located?3. Howcan the page be accessed?If every page were somehowassigned a unique name, there would not be anyambiguity in identifying pages.Nevertheless, the problem would not be solved.Consider a parallel between people and pages.In the United States, almost everyadult has a Social Security number,which is a unique identifier,asnotwo peopleare supposed to have the same one.Nevertheless, if you are armed only with asocial security number,there is no way to find the owner’saddress, and certainlyno way to tell whether you should write to the person in English, Spanish, or Chi-nese. TheWebhas basically the same problems.The solution chosen identifies pages in a way that solves all three problems atonce. Eachpage is assigned aURL(Uniform Resource Locator)that effectivelyserves as the page’sworldwide name.URLs have three parts: the protocol (alsoknown as thescheme), the DNS name of the machine on which the page is locat-ed, and the path uniquely indicating the specific page (a file to read or program torun on the machine). In the general case, the path has a hierarchical name thatmodels a file directory structure.However, the interpretation of the path is up tothe server; it may or may not reflect the actual directory structure.As an example, the URL of the page shown in Fig. 7-19 ishttps://fcc.gov/This URL consists of three parts: the protocol (https), the DNS name of the host(fcc.gov), and the path name (/,which the Web server often treats as some defaultindexobject).When a user selects a hyperlink, the browser carries out a series of steps inorder to fetch the page pointed to.Let us trace the steps that occur when our exam-ple link is selected:1. Thebrowser determines the URL (by seeing what was selected).2. Thebrowser asks DNS for the IP address of the serverfcc.gov.3. DNSreplies with 23.1.55.196.4. Thebrowser makes a TCP connection to that IP address; giventhatthe protocol is HTTPS, the secure version of HTTP,the TCP con-nection would by default be on port 443 (the default port for HTTP,which is used far less often now, isport 80).5. Itsends an HTTPS request asking for the page//,which the Web ser-vertypically assumes is some indexpage (e.g., index.html, index.php,or similar,asconfigured by the Web server atfcc.gov).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 678}, page_content='SEC. 7.3 THE WORLD WIDE WEB 6556. Theserver sends the page as an HTTPS response, for example, bysending the file/index.html,ifthat is determined to be the defaultindexobject.7. Ifthe page includes URLs that are needed for display,the browserfetches the other URLs using the same process.In this case, theURLs include multiple embedded images also fetched from that ser-ver, embedded objects fromgstatic.com,and a script fromgoogle-analytics.com(as well as a number of other domains that are notshown).8. Thebrowser displays the page/index.htmlas it appears in Fig. 7-19.9. TheTCP connections are released if there are no other requests to thesame servers for a short period.Manybrowsers display which step theyare currently executing in a status lineat the bottom of the screen.In this way,when the performance is poor,the usercan see if it is due to DNS not responding, a server not responding, or simply pagetransmission overasloworcongested network.Amore detailed way to explore and understand the performance of the Webpage is through a so-calledwaterfall diagram,asshown in Fig. 7-20.The figure shows a list of all of the objects that the browser loads in the proc-ess of loading this page (in this case, 64, but manypages have hundreds ofobjects), as well as the timing dependencies associated with loading each request,and the operations associated with each page load (e.g., a DNS lookup, a TCP con-nection, the downloading of actual content, and so forth). These waterfall diagramscan tell us a lot about the behavior of a Web browser; for example, we can learnabout the number of parallel connections that a browser makes to anygivenserver,as well as whether connections are being reused. Wecan also learn about the rela-tive time for DNS lookups versus actual object downloads, as well as other poten-tial performance bottlenecks.The URL design is open-ended in the sense that it is straightforward to havebrowsers use multiple protocols to retrieve different kinds of resources.In fact,URLs for various other protocols have been defined. Slightlysimplified forms ofthe common ones are listed in Fig. 7-21.Let us briefly go overthe list.Thehttpprotocol is the Web’snative language,the one spoken by Web servers.HTTPstands forHyperText Transfer Protocol.We will examine it in more detail later in this section, with a particular focus onHTTPS, the secure version of this protocol, which is nowthe predominant protocolused to serveobjects on the Web today.Theftpprotocol is used to access files by FTP,the Internet’sfile transfer proto-col.

This approach makes all the specialized user interface programsfor those other services unnecessary and integrates nearly all Internet access into asingle program: the Web browser.Ifitwere not for the fact that this idea wasthought of by a British physicist working a multinational European research lab inSwitzerland (CERN), it could easily pass for a plan dreamed up by some softwarecompany’sadvertising department.The ServerSideSo much for the client side.Nowlet us takealook at the server side.As wesawabove,when the user types in a URL or clicks on a line of hypertext, the brow-ser parses the URL and interprets the part betweenhttps://and the next slash as aDNS name to look up.Armed with the IP address of the server,the browser can'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 681}, page_content='658 THE APPLICATION LAYER CHAP.7establish a TCP connection to port 443 on that server.Then it sends overacom-mand containing the rest of the URL, which is the path to the page on that server.The server then returns the page for the browser to display.To a first approximation, a simple Web server is similar to the server ofFig. 6-6.That server is giventhe name of a file to look up and return via the net-work. Inboth cases, the steps that the server performs in its main loop are:1. AcceptaTCP connection from a client (a browser).2. Getthe path to the page, which is the name of the file requested.3. Getthe file (from disk).4. Sendthe contents of the file to the client.5. Releasethe TCP connection.Modern Web servers have more features, but in essence, this is what a Web serverdoes for the simple case of content that is contained in a file. For dynamic content,the third step may be replaced by the execution of a program (determined from thepath) that generates and returns the contents.However, Web servers are implemented with a different design to servehun-dreds or thousands of requests per second.One problem with the simple design isthat accessing files is often the bottleneck. Disk reads are very slowcompared toprogram execution, and the same files may be read repeatedly from disk usingoperating system calls.Another problem is that only one request is processed at atime. Ifthe file is large, other requests will be blocked while it is transferred.One obvious improvement (used by all Web servers) is to maintain a cache inmemory of thenmost recently read files or a certain number of gigabytes of con-tent. Beforegoing to disk to get a file, the server checks the cache.If the file isthere, it can be served directly from memory,thus eliminating the disk access.Although effective caching requires a large amount of main memory and someextra processing time to check the cache and manage its contents, the savings intime are nearly always worth the overhead and expense.To tackle the problem of serving more than a single request at a time, one strat-egyistomakethe servermultithreaded.Inone design, the server consists of afront-end module that accepts all incoming requests andkprocessing modules, asshown in Fig.7-22. Thek+ 1threads all belong to the same process, so the proc-essing modules all have access to the cache within the process’ address space.When a request comes in, the front end accepts it and builds a short record describ-ing it.It then hands the record to one of the processing modules.The processing module first checks the cache to see if the requested object ispresent. Ifso, it updates the record to include a pointer to the file in the record.Ifit is not there, the processing module starts a disk operation to read it into the cache(possibly discarding some other cached file(s) to makeroom for it).When the filecomes in from the disk, it is put in the cache and also sent back to the client.'),\n",

The front-end Web server isoften called areverse proxy,because it retrievescontent from other (typicallyback-end) servers and serves those objects to the client. The proxy is called a‘‘reverse’’proxy because it is acting on behalf of the servers, as opposed to actingon behalf of clients.When loading a Web page, a client will often first be directed (using DNS) to areverse proxy (i.e., front end server), which will begin returning static objects tothe client’sWeb browser so that it can begin loading some of the page contents asquickly as possible.While those (typically static) objects are loading, the back endcan perform complexoperations (e.g., performing a Web search, doing a databaselookup, or otherwise generating dynamic content), which it can serveback to theclient via the reverse proxy as those results and content becomes available.7.3.2 StaticWebObjectsThe basis of the Web is transferring Web pages from server to client.In thesimplest form, Web objects are static. However, these days, almost anypage thatyou viewonthe Web will have some dynamic content, but evenondynamic Webpages, a significant amount of the content (e.g., the logo, the style sheets, the head-er and footer) remains static.Static objects are just files sitting on some server thatpresent themselves in the same way each time theyare fetched and viewed.

A video is a staticobject, for example.As mentioned earlier,the lingua franca of the Web, in which most pages arewritten, is HTML. The home pages of university instructors are generally staticobjects; in some cases, companies may have dynamic Web pages, but the endresult of the dynamic-generation process is a page in HTML.HTML(HyperTextMarkup Language)was introduced with the Web.Itallows users to produce Webpages that include text, graphics, video, pointers to other Web pages, and more.HTML is a markup language, or language for describing howdocuments are to beformatted. Theterm ‘‘markup’’comes from the old days when copyeditors actual-ly marked up documents to tell the printer—in those days, a human being—whichfonts to use, and so on.Markup languages thus contain explicit commands for for-matting. For example, in HTML,<b>means start boldface mode, and</b>means leave boldface mode.Also,<h1>means to start a level1heading here.LaTeX and TeX are other examples of markup languages that are well known tomost academic authors.In contrast, Microsoft Word isnotamarkup languagebecause the formatting commands arenotembedded in the text.The key advantage of a markup language overone with no explicit markup isthat it separates content from howitshould be presented.Most modern Webpagesusestyle sheetsto define the typefaces, colors, sizes, padding, and manyotherattributes of text, lists, tables, headings, ads, and other page elements.Style sheetsare written in a language calledCSS(Cascading Style Sheets).Writing a browser is then straightforward: the browser simply has to under-stand the markup commands and style sheet and apply them to the content.Embedding all the markup commands within each HTML file and standardizingthem makes it possible for anyWeb browser to read and reformat anyWeb page.That is crucial because a page may have been produced in a 3840× 2160 windowwith 24-bit color on a high-end computer but may have tobedisplayed in a640× 320 windowonamobile phone.Just scaling it down linearly is a bad ideabecause then the letters would be so small that no one could read them.While it is certainly possible to write documents likethis with anyplain texteditor,and manypeople do, it is also possible to use word processors or specialHTML editors that do most of the work (but correspondingly give the user lessdirect control overthe details of the final result).There are also manyprogramsavailable for designing Web pages, such as Adobe Dreamweaver.7.3.3 DynamicWebPages and Web ApplicationsThe static page model we have used so far treats pages as (multimedia) docu-ments that are conveniently linked together.Itwas a good model back in the earlydays of the Web, as vast amounts of information were put online.Nowadays,'),\n",

The twist is that these applications run inside the browser,with user data stored on servers in Internet data centers.Theyuse Web protocolsto access information via the Internet, and the browser to display a user interface.The advantage of this approach is that users do not need to install separate applica-tion programs, and user data can be accessed from different computers and backedup by the service operator.Itisproving so successful that it is rivaling traditionalapplication software. Of course, the fact that these applications are offered for freeby large providers helps.This model is a prevalent form ofcloud computing,where computing movesoff individual desktop computers and into shared clustersof servers in the Internet.To act as applications, Web pages can no longer be static. Dynamic content isneeded. For example, a page of the library catalog should reflect which books arecurrently available and which books are checked out and are thus not available.Similarly,auseful stock market page would allowthe user to interact with the pageto see stock prices overdifferent periods of time and compute profits and losses.As these examples suggest, dynamic content can be generated by programs run-ning on the server or in the browser (or in both places).The general situation is as shown in Fig.7-23. For example, consider a mapservice that lets the user enter a street address and presents a corresponding map ofthe location. Givenarequest for a location, the Web server must use a program tocreate a page that shows the map for the location from a database of streets andother geographic information. This action is shown as steps 1 through 3. Therequest (step 1) causes a program to run on the server.The program consults adatabase to generate the appropriate page (step 2) and returns it to the browser(step 3). 1 ProgramProgramWeb serverWeb browser\\n357 26WebpageProgram4 DB\\nFigure7-23.Dynamic pages.There is more to dynamic content, however.

The programwill then continue updating the page (step 4). The requests and responses happenin the background; the user may not evenbeaware of them because the page URLand title typically do not change.By including client-side programs, the page canpresent a more responsive interface than with server-side programs alone.Server-Side Dynamic Web Page GenerationLet us look briefly at the case of server-side content generation.When the userclicks on a link in a form, for example in order to buy something, a request is sentto the server at the URL specified with the form along with the contents of theform as filled in by the user.These data must be giventoaprogram or script toprocess. Thus, the URL identifies the program to run; the data are provided to theprogram as input.The page returned by this request will depend on what happensduring the processing. It is not fixed likeastatic page.If the order succeeds, thepage returned might give the expected shipping date. If it is unsuccessful, the re-turned page might say that widgets requested are out of stock or the credit card wasnot valid for some reason.Exactly howthe server runs a program instead of retrieving a file depends onthe design of the Web server.Itisnot specified by the Web protocols themselves.This is because the interface can be proprietary and the browser does not need toknowthe details. As far as the browser is concerned, it is simply making a requestand fetching a page.Nonetheless, standard APIs have been developed for Web servers to invokeprograms. The existence of these interfaces makes it easier for developers to extenddifferent servers with Web applications. Wewill briefly look at twoAPIs to giveyou a sense of what theyentail.The first API is a method for handling dynamic page requests that has beenavailable since the beginning of the Web.Itiscalled theCGI(Common GatewayInterface)and is defined in RFC 3875.CGI provides an interface to allowWebservers to talk to back-end programs and scripts that can accept input (e.g., fromforms) and generate HTML pages in response.These programs may be written inwhateverlanguage is convenient for the developer,usually a scripting language forease of development. Pick Python, Ruby,Perl, or your favorite language.By convention, programs invokedvia CGI live inadirectory calledcgi-bin,which is visible in the URL.The server maps a request to this directory to a pro-gram name and executes that program as a separate process.It provides anydatasent with the request as input to the program.The output of the program givesaWebpage that is returned to the browser.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 686}, page_content='SEC. 7.3 THE WORLD WIDE WEB 663The second API is quite different. Theapproach here is to embed little scriptsinside HTML pages and have them be executed by the server itself to generate thepage. Apopular language for writing these scripts isPHP(PHP: Hypertext Pre-processor). Touse it, the server has to understand PHP,just as a browser has tounderstand CSS to interpret Web pages with style sheets.Usually,servers identifyWebpages containing PHP from the file extensionphprather thanhtmlorhtm.PHP is simpler to use than CGI and is widely used.Although PHP is easy to use, it is actually a powerful programming languagefor interfacing the Web and a server database.It has variables, strings, arrays, andmost of the control structures found in C, but much more powerful I/O than justprintf.PHP is open source code, freely available, and widely used.It wasdesigned specifically to work well with Apache, which is also open source and isthe world’smost widely used Web server.Client-Side Dynamic Web Page GenerationPHP and CGI scripts solvethe problem of handling input and interactions withdatabases on the server.Theycan all accept incoming information from forms,look up information in one or more databases, and generate HTML pages with theresults. Whatnone of them can do is respond to mouse movements or interact withusers directly.For this purpose, it is necessary to have scripts embedded in HTMLpages that are executed on the client machine rather than the server machine.Starting with HTML 4.0, such scripts were permitted using the tag<script>.Thecurrent HTML standard is nowgenerally referred to asHTML5.HTML5includes manynew syntactic features for incorporating multimedia and graphicalcontent, including<video>,<audio>,and<canvas>tags. Notably,the canvasele-ment facilitates dynamic rendering of two-dimensional shapes and bitmap images.Interestingly,the canvaselement also has various privacy considerations, becausethe HTML canvasproperties are often unique on different devices. The privacyconcerns are significant, because the uniqueness of canvases on individual userdevices allows Web site operators to track users, evenifthe users delete all track-ing cookies and block tracking scripts.The most popular scripting language for the client side isJavaScript,sowewill nowtakeaquick look at it.Manybooks have been written about it (e.g., Cod-ing, 2019; and Atencio, 2020).Despite the similarity in names, JavaScript has al-most nothing to do with the Java programming language.Likeother scripting lan-guages, it is a very high-levellanguage. For example, in a single line of JavaScriptit is possible to pop up a dialog box, wait for text input, and store the resultingstring in a variable. High-levelfeatures likethis makeJavaScript ideal for design-ing interactive Web pages.On the other hand, the fact that it is mutating fasterthan a fruit fly trapped in an X-ray machine makes it difficult to write JavaScriptprograms that work on all platforms, but maybe some day it will stabilize.'),\n",

Asaconsequence, the result is displayed virtually instanta-neously,whereas with PHP there can be a delay of several seconds before theresulting HTML arrivesatthe client.This difference does not mean that JavaScript is better than PHP.Their usesare completely different. PHPis used when interaction with a database on the ser-verisneeded. JavaScript (and other client-side languages) is used when the inter-action is with the user at the client computer.Itiscertainly possible to combinethem, as we will see shortly.7.3.4 HTTPand HTTPSNowthat we have anunderstanding of Web content and applications, it is timeto look at the protocol that is used to transport all this information between Webservers and clients. It isHTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol), as specified inRFC 2616.Before we get into too manydetails, it is worth noting some dis-tinctions between HTTP and its secure counterpart,HTTPS(SecureHyperTextTransfer Protocol). Bothprotocols essentially retrieve objects in the same way,and the HTTP standard to retrieve Web objects is evolving essentially indepen-dently from its secure counterpart, which effectively uses the HTTP protocol overasecure transport protocol calledTLS(Transport Layer Security).

Chapter8discusses TLS in more detail, which effectively is the transportprotocol that transports HTTP,constituting what we think of as HTTPS. For theremainder of this section, we will talk about HTTP; you can think of HTTPS assimply HTTP that is transported overTLS.OverviewHTTP is a simple request-response protocol; conventional versions of HTTPtypically run overTCP,although the most modern version of HTTP,HTTP/3, nowcommonly runs overUDP as well. It specifies what messages clients may send toservers and what responses theyget back in return.The request and responseheaders are giveninASCII, just likeinSMTP.The contents are giveninaMIME-likeformat, also likeinSMTP.This simple model was partly responsible for theearly success of the Web because it made development and deployment straightfor-ward.In this section, we will look at the more important properties of HTTP as it isused today.Before getting into the details we will note that the way it is used in theInternet is evolving. HTTPis an application layer protocol because it runs on topof TCP and is closely associated with the Web.That is whyweare covering it inthis chapter.Inanother sense, HTTP is becoming more likeatransport protocolthat provides a way for processes to communicate content across the boundaries ofdifferent networks. These processes do not have tobeaWeb browser and Web ser-ver. A media player could use HTTP to talk to a server and request album infor-mation. Antivirus software could use HTTP to download the latest updates.Developers could use HTTP to fetch project files. Consumerelectronics productslikedigital photo frames often use an embedded HTTP server as an interface to theoutside world. Machine-to-machinecommunication increasingly runs overHTTP.Forexample, an airline server might contact a car rental server and makeacarreservation, all as part of a vacation package the airline was offering.MethodsAlthough HTTP was designed for use in the Web, it was intentionally mademore general than necessary with an eye to future object-oriented uses.Forthisreason, operations, calledmethods,other than just requesting a Web page are sup-ported.Each request consists of one or more lines of ASCII text, with the first word onthe first line being the name of the method requested.The built-in methods arelisted in Fig. 7-25.The names are case sensitive,soGETis allowed but notget.TheGETmethod requests the server to send the page.(When we say ‘‘page’’we mean ‘‘object’’inthe most general case, but thinking of a page as the contentsof a file is sufficient to understand the concepts.)The page is suitably encoded in'),\n",

The effectmight be to purchase an item, for example, or to call a procedure.Finally,themethod returns a page indicating the result.The remaining methods are not used much for browsing the Web.ThePUTmethod is the reverse ofGET:instead of reading the page, it writes the page.Thismethod makes it possible to build a collection of Web pages on a remote server.The body of the request contains the page.It may be encoded using MIME, inwhich case the lines following thePUTmight include authentication headers, toprove that the caller indeed has permission to perform the requested operation.DELETEdoes what you might expect: it removesthe page, or at least it indi-cates that the Web server has agreed to remove the page.As withPUT,authentica-tion and permission play a major role here.TheTRACEmethod is for debugging.

Thefirst digit is used to divide the responses into fivemajor groups, as shownin Fig. 7-26.Code MeaningExamples1xx Information100 = serveragrees to handle client’ srequest2xx Success200 = request succeeded; 204 = no content present3xx Redirection301 = page moved; 304 = cached page still valid4xx Clienterror 403=forbidden page; 404 = page not found5xx Servererror 500=internalserver error;503 = tryagain laterFigure7-26.The status code response groups.The 1xx codes are rarely used in practice.The 2xx codes mean that the requestwashandled successfully and the content (if any) is being returned.The 3xx codestell the client to look elsewhere, either using a different URL or in its own cache(discussed later).The 4xx codes mean the request failed due to a client error suchan invalid request or a nonexistent page.Finally,the 5xx errors mean the serveritself has an internal problem, either due to an error in its code or to a temporaryoverload.Message HeadersThe request line (e.g., the line with theGETmethod) may be followed by addi-tional lines with more information.Theyare calledrequest headers.This infor-mation can be compared to the parameters of a procedure call.Responses mayalso haveresponse headers.Some headers can be used in either direction.Aselection of the more important ones is giveninFig. 7-27.This list is not short, soas you might imagine there are often several headers on each request and response.TheUser-Agentheader allows the client to inform the server about its browserimplementation (e.g.,Mozilla/5.0andChrome/74.0.3729.169). Thisinformation isuseful to let servers tailor their responses to the browser,since different browserscan have widely varying capabilities and behaviors.The fourAcceptheaders tell the server what the client is willing to accept inthe event that it has a limited repertoire of what is acceptable to it.The first headerspecifies the MIME types that are welcome (e.g.,text/html). Thesecond givesthecharacter set (e.g.,ISO-8859-5orUnicode-1-1). Thethird deals with compressionmethods (e.g.,gzip).

Mostoften this is the URL of the previ-ous page.This header is particularly useful for tracking Web browsing, as it tellsservers howaclient arrivedatthe page.Cookiesare small files that servers place on client computers to rememberinformation for later.Atypical example is an e-commerce Web site that uses a cli-ent-side cookie to keep track of what the client has ordered so far.Every time theclient adds an item to her shopping cart, the cookie is updated to reflect the newitem ordered.Although cookies are dealt with in RFC 2109 rather than RFC 2616,theyalso have headers. TheSet-Cookieheader is howservers send cookies to cli-ents. Theclient is expected to save the cookie and return it on subsequent requeststo the server by using theCookieheader.(Note that there is a more recent specif-ication for cookies with newer headers, RFC 2965, but this has largely been reject-ed by industry and is not widely implemented.)Manyother headers are used in responses.TheServerheader allows the serverto identify its software build if it wishes.The next fiveheaders, all starting withContent-,allowthe server to describe properties of the page it is sending.TheLast-Modifiedheader tells when the page was last modified, and theExpiresheader tells for howlong the page will remain valid. Bothof these headersplay an important role in page caching.TheLocationheader is used by the server to inform the client that it should tryadifferent URL.This can be used if the page has movedortoallowmultipleURLs to refer to the same page (possibly on different servers). Itis also used forcompanies that have a main Web page in thecomdomain but redirect clients to anational or regional page based on their IP addresses or preferred language.If a page is large, a small client may not want it all at once.Some servers willaccept requests for byte ranges, so the page can be fetched in multiple small units.TheAccept-Rangesheader announces the server’swillingness to handle this.Nowwecome to headers that can be used either way.TheDateheader can beused in both directions and contains the time and date the message was sent, whiletheRangeheader tells the byte range of the page that is provided by the response.TheETagheader givesashort tag that serves as a name for the content of thepage. It is used for caching.TheCache-Controlheader givesother explicit instruc-tions about howtocache (or,more usually,how not to cache) pages.Finally,theUpgradeheader is used for switching to a newcommunicationprotocol, such as a future HTTP protocol or a secure transport.It allows the clientto announce what it can support and the server to assert what it is using.CachingPeople often return to Web pages that theyhaveviewed before, and relatedWebpages often have the same embedded resources.

It would be very wasteful to fetch all of these resources for these pageseach time theyare displayed because the browser already has a copy.Squirreling awaypages that are fetched for subsequent use is calledcaching.The advantage is that when a cached page can be reused, it is not necessary torepeat the transfer.HTTP has built-in support to help clients identify when theycan safely reuse pages.This support improvesperformance by reducing both net-work trafficand latency. The trade-offisthat the browser must nowstore pages,butthis is nearly always a worthwhile trade-offbecause local storage is inexpen-sive.The pages are usually kept on disk so that theycan be used when the browseris run at a later date.The difficult issue with HTTP caching is howtodetermine that a previouslycached copyofapage is the same as the page would be if it was fetched again.This determination cannot be made solely from the URL. For example, the URLmay give a page that displays the latest news item. The contents of this page willbe updated frequently eventhough the URL stays the same. Alternatively,the con-tents of the page may be a list of the gods from Greek and Roman mythology.Thispage should change somewhat less rapidly.HTTP uses twostrategies to tackle this problem.Theyare shown in Fig.7-28as forms of processing between the request (step 1) and the response (step 5).Thefirst strategy is page validation (step 2).The cache is consulted, and if it has acopyofapage for the requested URL that is known to be fresh (i.e., still valid),there is no need to fetch it anewfrom the server.Instead, the cached page can bereturned directly.TheExpiresheader returned when the cached page was originallyfetched and the current date and time can be used to makethis determination.\\n4a: Not modified\\nWeb browserCache Web server\\n2: Check expiry1: Request3: Conditional GET\\n4b: Response5: Response Program\\nFigure7-28.HTTP caching.However, not all pages come with a convenientExpiresheader that tells whenthe page must be fetched again. Afterall, making predictions is hard—especiallyabout the future.In this case, the browser may use heuristics. For example, if thepage has not been modified in the past year (as told by theLast-Modifiedheader) itis a fairly safe bet that it will not change in the next hour.There is no guarantee,however, and this may be a bad bet.Forexample, the stock market might haveclosed for the day so that the page will not change for hours, but it will changerapidly once the next trading session starts.Thus, the cacheability of a page may'),\n",

For this reason, heuristics should be used with care, thoughtheyoften work well in practice.Finding pages that have not expired is the most beneficial use of cachingbecause it means that the server does not need to be contacted at all. Unfortunately,it does not always work. Servers must use theExpiresheader conservatively,sincetheymay be unsure when a page will be updated.Thus, the cached copies maystill be fresh, but the client does not know.The second strategy is used in this case.It is to ask the server if the cachedcopyisstill valid. Thisrequest is aconditional GET,and it is shown in Fig.7-28as step 3.If the server knows that the cached copyisstill valid, it can send a shortreply to say so (step 4a).Otherwise, it must send the full response (step 4b).More header fields are used to let the server check whether a cached copyisstill valid. The client has the time a cached page was most recently updated fromtheLast-Modifiedheader.Itcan send this time to the server using theIf-Modi-fied-Sinceheader to ask for the page if and only if it has been changed in the mean-time. Thereis much more to say about caching because it has such a big effect onperformance, but this is not the place to say it.Not surprisingly,there are manytutorials on the Web that you can find easily by searching for ‘‘Web caching.’’HTTP/1 and HTTP/1.1The usual way for a browser to contact a server is to establish a TCP con-nection to port 443 for HTTPS (or port 80 for HTTP) on the server’smachine,although this procedure is not formally required.The value of using TCP is thatneither browsers nor servers have toworry about howtohandle long messages,reliability,orcongestion control.All of these matters are handled by the TCPimplementation.Early in the Web, with HTTP/1.0, after the connection was established a singlerequest was sent overand a single response was sent back.Then the TCP con-nection was released.In a world in which the typical Web page consisted entirelyof HTML text, this method was adequate.Quickly,the average Web page grewtocontain large numbers of embedded links for content such as icons and other eyecandy.Establishing a separate TCP connection to transport each single iconbecame a very expensive way to operate.This observation led to HTTP/1.1, which supportspersistent connections.With them, it is possible to establish a TCP connection, send a request and get aresponse, and then send additional requests and get additional responses.Thisstrategy is also calledconnection reuse.Byamortizing the TCP setup, startup,and release costs overmultiple requests, the relative overhead due to TCP isreduced per request.It is also possible to pipeline requests, that is, send request 2before the response to request 1 has arrived.The performance difference between these three cases is shown in Fig.7-29.Part (a) shows three requests, one after the other and each in a separate connection.'),\n",

Observethatthe fetch completes more quickly.There are tworeasons for the speedup.First,time is not wasted setting up additional connections.Each TCP connectionrequires at least one round-trip time to establish. Second, the transfer of the sameimages proceeds more quickly.Why isthis? It is because of TCP congestion con-trol. At the start of a connection, TCP uses the slow-start procedure to increase thethroughput until it learns the behavior of the network path. The consequence of thiswarmup period is that multiple short TCP connections takedisproportionatelylonger to transfer information than one longer TCP connection.Finally,inFig. 7-29(c),there is one persistent connection and the requests arepipelined.

There is a good chance that the user will click onalink that requests another page from the server.Ifthe connection remains open,the next request can be sent immediately.However, there is no guarantee that theclient will makeanother request of the server anytime soon. In practice, clientsand servers usually keep persistent connections open until theyhavebeen idle for ashort time (e.g., 60 seconds) or theyhavealarge number of open connections andneed to close some.The observant reader may have noticed that there is one combination that wehave left out so far.Itisalso possible to send one request per TCP connection, butrun multiple TCP connections in parallel. Thisparallel connectionmethod waswidely used by browsers before persistent connections. It has the same disadvan-tage as sequential connections—extra overhead—but much better performance.This is because setting up and ramping up the connections in parallel hides someof the latency. Inour example, connections for both of the embedded images couldbe set up at the same time.However, running manyTCP connections to the sameserver is discouraged. The reason is that TCP performs congestion control for eachconnection independently.Asaconsequence, the connections compete againsteach other,causing added packet loss, and in aggregate are more aggressive usersof the network than an individual connection. Persistent connections are superiorand used in preference to parallel connections because theyavoid overhead and donot suffer from congestion problems.HTTP/2HTTP/1.0 was around from the start of the Web and HTTP/1.1 was written in2007. By2012 it was getting a bit long in tooth, so IETF set up a working groupto create what later became HTTP/2. The starting point was a protocol Google haddevised earlier,called SPDY. The final product was published as RFC 7540 in May2015.The working group had several goals it tried to achieve,including:1. Allowclients and servers to choose which HTTP version to use.2. Maintaincompatibility with HTTP/1.1 as much as possible.3. Improve performance with multiplexing, pipelining, compression, etc.4. Supportexisting practices used in browsers, servers, proxies, deliverynetworks, and more.Akey idea was to maintain backward compatibility.Existing applications hadto work with HTTP/2, but newones could takeadvantage of the newfeatures toimprove performance.

What changed was the way everything is encoded and thewaythe clients and servers interact.In HTTP/1.1, a client opens a TCP connectionto a server,sends overarequest as text, waits for a response, and in manycasesthen closes the connection. This is repeated as often as needed to fetch an entireWebpage. In HTTP/2 A TCP connection is set up and manyrequests can be sentover, inbinary,possibly prioritized, and the server can respond to them in anyorder it wants to. Only after all requests have been answered is the TCP connectiontorn down.Through a mechanism calledserverpush,HTTP/2 allows the server to pushout files that it knows will be needed but which the client may not knowinitially.Forexample, if a client requests a Web page and the server sees that it uses a stylesheet and a JavaScript file, the server can send overthe style sheet and theJavaScript before theyare evenrequested. This eliminates some delays.An exam-ple of getting the same information (a Web page, its style sheet, and twoimages) inHTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 is shown in Fig. 7-30.\\nUser\\nServer\\nTime(a) (b)Time\\nRequest style sheetHere is the style sheetRequest image 1Here is image 1\\nHere is image 1\\nRequest image 1Request image 2\\nRequest image 2Here is image 2\\nHere is image 2\\nRequest pageHere is the page\\nRequest pageHere is the page + style sheet\\nFigure7-30.(a) Getting a Web page in HTTP/1.1.

That isnot allowed in HTTP/1.1.Also note that in Fig.7-30(b) the server sent the stylesheet without the browser asking for it.In addition to the pipelining and multiplexing of requests overthe same TCPconnection, HTTP/2 compresses the headers and sends them in binary to reducebandwidth usage and latency. AnHTTP/2 session consists of a series of frames,each with a separate identifier.Responses may come back in a different order thanthe requests, as in Fig.7-30(b), but since each response carries the identifier of therequest, the browser can determine which request each response corresponds to.Encryption was a sore point during the development of HTTP/2.Some peoplewanted it badly,and others opposed it equally badly.The opposition was mostlyrelated to Internet-of-Things applications, in which the ‘‘thing’’does not have a lotof computing power.Inthe end, encryption was not required by the standard, butall browsers require encryption, so de facto it is there anyway,atleast for Webbrowsing.HTTP/3HTTP/3or simplyH3is the third major revision of HTTP,designed as a suc-cessor to HTTP/2.The major distinction for HTTP/3 is the transport protocol thatit uses to support the HTTP messages: rather than relying on TCP,itrelies on anaugmented version of UDP calledQUIC,which relies on user-space congestioncontrol running on top of UDP.HTTP/3 started out simply as HTTP-over-QUICand has become the latest proposed major revision to the protocol. Manyopen-source libraries that support client and server logic for QUIC and HTTP/3 areavailable, in languages that include C, C++, Python, Rust, and Go. Popular Webservers including nginx also nowsupport HTTP/3 through patches.The QUIC transport protocol supports stream multiplexing and per-streamflowcontrol, similar to that offered in HTTP/2. Stream-levelreliability and con-nection-wide congestion control can dramatically improve the performance ofHTTP,since congestion information can be shared across sessions, and reliabilitycan be amortized across multiple connections fetching objects in parallel. Once aconnection exists to a server endpoint, HTTP/3 allows the client to reuse that sameconnection with multiple different URLs.HTTP/3, running HTTP overQUIC, promises manypossible performanceenhancements overHTTP/2, primarily because of the benefits that QUIC offers forHTTP vs. TCP.Insome ways, QUIC could be viewed as the next generation ofTCP.Itoffers connection setup with no additional round trips between client andserver; in the case when a previous connection has been established between clientand server,azero-round-trip connection re-establishment is possible, provided thatasecret from the previous connection was established and cached.QUIC guaran-tees reliable, in-order delivery of bytes within a single stream, but it does not'),\n",

Web sites, Web applications, and other thirdparties often use mechanisms in HTTP to track user behavior,both within the con-text of a single Web site or application, or across the Internet. Additionally,attack-ers may exploit various information side channels in the browser or device to trackusers. Thissection describes some of the mechanisms that are used to track usersand fingerprint individual users and devices.CookiesOne conventional way to implement tracking is by placing acookie(effec-tively a small amount of data) on client devices, which the clients may then sendback upon subsequent visits to various Web sites.When a user requests a Webobject (e.g., a Web page), a Web server may place a piece of persistent state, calledacookie, on the user’sdevice, using the ‘‘set-cookie’’directive inHTTP.The datapassed to the client’sdevice using this directive issubsequently stored locally onthe device. When the device visits that Web domain in the future, the HTTPrequest passes the cookie, in addition to the request itself.‘‘First-party’’HTTP cookies (i.e., those set by the domain of the Web site thatthe user intends to visit, such as a shopping or news Web site) are useful forimproving user experience on manyWeb sites. For example, cookies are often usedto preservestate across a Web ‘‘session.’’ TheyallowaWeb site to track usefulinformation about a user’songoing behavior on a Web site, such as whether theyrecently logged into the Web site, or what items theyhaveplaced in a shoppingcart.Cookies set by one domain are generally only visible to the same domain thatset the cookie in the first place. For example, one advertising network may set acookie on a user device, but no other third party can see the cookie that was set.This Web security policy, called thesame-origin policy,prevents one party fromreading a cookie that was set by another party and in some sense can limit howinformation about an individual user is shared.Although first-party cookies are often used to improve the user experience,third parties, such as advertisers and tracking companies can also set cookies onclient devices, which can allowthose third parties to track the sites that users visit'),\n",

This tracking takesplace as follows:1. Whenauser visits a Web site, in addition to the content that the userrequests directly,the device may load content from third-party sites,including from the domains of advertising networks. Loading anadvertisement or script from a third party allows that party to set aunique cookie on the user’sdevice.2. Thatuser may subsequently visit different sites on the Internet thatload Web objects from the same third party that set tracking infor-mation on a different site.Acommon example of this practice might be twodifferent Web sites that usethe same advertising network to serveads. In this case, the advertising networkwould see: (1) the user’sdevice return the cookie that it set on a different Web site;(2) the HTTPrefererrequest header that accompanies the request to load the objectfrom the advertiser,indicating the original site that the user’sdevice was visiting.This practice is commonly referred to as cross-site tracking.Super cookies,and other locally stored tracking identifiers, that a user cannotcontrol as theywould regular cookies, can allowanintermediary to track a user a-cross Web sites overtime. Uniqueidentifiers can include things such as third-partytracking identifiers encoded in HTTP (specificallyHSTS(HTTP Strict Trans-port Security)headers that are not cleared when a user clears their cookies andtags that an intermediate third party such as a mobile ISP can insert into unencryp-ted Web trafficthat traverses a network segment. This enables third parties, such asadvertisers, to build up a profile of a user’sbrowsing across a set of Web sites, sim-ilar to the Web tracking cookies used by ad networks and application providers.Third-Party TrackersWebcookies that originate from a third-party domain that are used acrossmanysites can allowanadvertising network or other third parties to track a user’sbrowsing habits on anysite where that tracking software is deployed (i.e., anysitethat carries their advertisements, sharing buttons, or other embedded code). Adver-tising networks and other third parties typically track a user’sbrowsing patterns a-cross the range of Web sites that the user browses, often using browser-basedtracking software. In some cases, a third party may develop its own tracking soft-ware (e.g., Web analytics software). In other cases, theymay use a different third-party service to collect and aggregate this behavior across sites.Websites may permit advertising networks and other third-party trackers tooperate on their site, enabling them to collect analytics data, advertise on otherWebsites (called re-targeting), or monetize the Web site’savailable advertisingspace via placement of carefully targeted ads.

When a user visits multiple Web sites that leverage thesame advertising network, that advertising network recognizes the user’sdevice,enabling them to track user Web behavior overtime.Using such tracking software, a third party or advertising network can discoverauser’sinteractions, social network and contacts, likes, interests, purchases, and soon. This information can enable precise tracking of whether an advertisementresulted in a purchase, mapping of relationships between people, creation ofdetailed user tracking profiles, conduct of highly targeted advertising, and signifi-cantly more due to the breadth and scope of tracking.Even in cases where someone is not a registered user of a particular service(e.g., social media site, search engine), has ceased using that service, or has loggedout of that service, theyoften are still being uniquely tracked using third-party (andfirst-party) trackers. Third-partytrackers are increasingly becoming concentratedwith a fewlarge providers.In addition to third-party tracking with cookies, the same advertisers and third-party trackers can track user browsing behavior with techniques such as canvasfin-gerprinting (a type of browser fingerprinting), session replay (whereby a thirdparty can see a playback of every user interaction with a particular Webpage), andevenexploitation of a browser or password manager’s‘‘auto-fill’’feature to sendback data from Web forms, often before a user evenfills out the form. These moresophisticated technologies can provide detailed information about user behaviorand data, including fine-grained details such as the user’sscrolls and mouse-clicksand eveninsome instances the user’susername and password for a givenWeb site(which can be either intentional on the part of the user or unintentional on the partof the Web site).Arecent study suggests that specific instances of third-party tracking softwareare pervasive.The same study also discovered that news sites have the largest num-ber of tracking parties on anygivenfirst-party site; other popular categories fortracking include arts, sports, and shopping Web sites.Cross-device tracking refersto the practice of linking activities of a single user across multiple devices (e.g.,smartphones, tablets, desktop machines, other ‘‘smart devices’’); the practice aimsto track a user’sbehavior,evenastheyuse different devices.Certain aspects of cross-device tracking may improve user experience. Forexample, as with cookies on a single device or browser,cross-device tracking canallowauser to maintain a seamless experience when moving from one device tothe next (e.g., continuing to read a book or watch a movie from the place where theuser left off). Cross-device tracking can also be useful for preventing fraud; forexample, a service provider may notice that a user has logged in from an unfamil-iar device in a completely newlocation. When a user attempts a login from anunrecognized device, a service provider can takeadditional steps to authenticatethe user (e.g., two-factor authentication).'),\n",

Cross-device tracking may be deterministic, based on a persistentidentifier such as a login that is tied to a specific user.2. Cross-device tracking may also be probabilistic; the IP address is oneexample of a probabilistic identifier that can be used to implementcross-device tracking. For example, technologies such as networkaddress translation can cause multiple devices on a network to havethe same public IP address. Suppose that a user visits a Web site fromamobile device (e.g., a smartphone) and uses that device at bothhome and work. A third party can set IP address information in thedevice’scookies. That user may then appear from twopublic IPaddresses, one at work, and one at home, and those twoIPaddressesmay be linked by the same third party cookie; if the user then visitsthat third party from different devices that share either of those twoIPaddresses, then those additional devices can be linked to the sameuser with high confidence.Cross-device tracking often uses a combination of deterministic and proba-bilistic techniques; manyofthese techniques do not require the user to be loggedinto anysite to enable this type of tracking. For example, some parties offer ‘‘ana-lytics’’services that, when embedded across manyfirst-party Web sites, allowthethird-party to track a user across Web sites and devices. Thirdparties often worktogether to track users across devices and services using a practice calledcookiesyncing,described in more detail later in this section.Cross-device tracking enables more sophisticated inference of higher-leveluseractivities, since data from different devices can be combined to build a more com-prehensive picture of an individual user’sactivity.For example, data about a user’slocation (as collected from a mobile device) can be combined with a user’ssearchhistory,social network activity (such as ‘‘likes’’) to determine for example whetherauser has physically visited a store following an online search or online advertis-ing exposure.Device and Browser FingerprintingEven when users disable common tracking mechanisms such as third-partycookies, Web sites and third parties can still track users based on environmental,contextual, and device information that the device returns to the server.Based on acollection of this information, a third party may be able to uniquely identify,or’’fingerprint,’’ a user across different sites and overtime.'),\n",

The technique was first discovered in 2012, but not brought to public atten-tion until 2014. Although there was a backlash at that time, manytrackers continueto use canvasfingerprinting and related techniques such as canvasfont fingerprint-ing, which identifies a device based on the browser’sfont list; a recent study foundthat these techniques are still present on thousands of sites. Web sites can also usebrowser APIs to retrieve other information for tracking devices, including infor-mation such as the battery status, which can be used to track a user based on bat-tery charge leveland discharge time. Other reports describe howknowing the bat-tery status of a device can be used to track a device and therefore associate a devicewith a user (Olejnik et al., 2015)Cookie SyncingWhen different third-party trackers share information with each other,theseparties can track an individual user evenastheyvisit Web sites that have differenttracking mechanisms installed.Cookie syncingis difficult to detect and also facil-itates merging of datasets about individual users between disparate third parties,creating significant privacy concerns.

For manypeople, audio and video are the holy grail of networking. Whenthe word ‘‘multi-media’’ismentioned, both the propellerheads and the suits begin salivating as if oncue. Theformer see immense technical challenges in providing good quality voiceoverIPand 8K video-on-demand to every computer.The latter see equallyimmense profits in it.While the idea of sending audio and video overthe Internet has been aroundsince the 1970s at least, it is only since roughly 2000 thatreal-time audioandreal-time videotraffichas grown with a vengeance. Real-time trafficisdifferentfrom Web trafficinthat it must be played out at some predetermined rate to be use-ful.

Long-haul links in the core of theInternet run at manygigabits/sec, and broadband and 802.11ac wireless reachesusers at the edge of the Internet.These developments allowISPs to carry tremen-dous levels of trafficacross their backbones and mean that ordinary users can con-nect to the Internet 100–1000 times faster than with a 56-kbps telephone modem.The flood of bandwidth caused audio and video traffictogrow, but for dif-ferent reasons. Telephone calls takeuprelatively little bandwidth (in principle 64kbps but less when compressed) yet telephone service has traditionally been expen-sive.Companies sawanopportunity to carry voice trafficoverthe Internet usingexisting bandwidth to cut down on their telephone bills. Startups such as Skypesawaway to let customers makefree telephone calls using their Internet con-nections. Upstart telephone companies sawacheap way to carry traditional voicecalls using IP networking equipment.The result was an explosion of voice datacarried overthe Internet and called Internet telephonyand discussed in Sec. 7.4.4.Unlikeaudio, video takes up a large amount of bandwidth.Reasonable qualityInternet video is encoded with compression resulting in a stream of around 8 Mbpsfor 4K (which is 7 GB for a 2-hour movie) Before broadband Internet access, send-ing movies overthe network was prohibitive.Not so anymore. With the spread ofbroadband, it became possible for the first time for users to watch decent, streamedvideo at home. People love todoit. Around a quarter of the Internet users on anygivenday are estimated to visit YouTube, the popular video sharing site. Themovie rental business has shifted to online downloads. And the sheer size of videoshas changed the overall makeup of Internet traffic. Themajority of Internet trafficis already video, and it is estimated that 90% of Internet trafficwill be video withinafew years.Giventhat there is enough bandwidth to carry audio and video, the key issuefor designing streaming and conferencing applications is network delay.Audio andvideo need real-time presentation, meaning that theymust be played out at apredetermined rate to be useful.Long delays mean that calls that should be inter-active nolonger are. This problem is clear if you have evertalked on a satellitephone, where the delay of up to half a second is quite distracting. For playingmusic and movies overthe network, the absolute delay does not matter,because itonly affects when the media starts to play.But the variation in delay,calledjitter,still matters. It must be masked by the player or the audio will sound unintelligibleand the video will look jerky.As an aside, the termmultimediais often used in the context of the Internet tomean video and audio.Literally,multimedia is just twoormore media.That defi-nition makes this book a multimedia presentation, as it contains text and graphics(the figures).

Ifwe define the lowerlimit of audibility (a sound pressure of about 20µ Pascals) for a 1-kHz sine waveas 0 dB, an ordinary conversation is about 50 dB and the pain threshold is about120 dB. The dynamic range is a factor of more than 1 million.The ear is surprisingly sensitive tosound variations lasting only a fewmillisec-onds. Theeye, in contrast, does not notice changes in light levelthat last only afewmilliseconds. Theresult of this observation is that jitter of only a fewmillisec-onds during the playout of multimedia affects the perceivedsound quality muchmore than it affects the perceivedimage quality.Digital audio is a digital representation of an audio wavethat can be used torecreate it.Audio wavescan be converted to digital form by anADC(Analog-to-Digital Converter). AnADC takes an electrical voltage as input and generates abinary number as output.In Fig.7-31(a) we see an example of a sine wave.Torepresent this signal digitally,wecan sample it every6 Tseconds, as shown by thebar heights in Fig.7-31(b). Ifasound waveis not a pure sine wavebutalinearsuperposition of sine waveswhere the highest frequencycomponent present isf,the Nyquist theorem (see Chap. 2) states that it is sufficient to makesamples at afrequency2f.Sampling more often is of no value since the higher frequenciesthat such sampling could detect are not present.The reverse process takes digital values and produces an analog electrical volt-age. It is done by aDAC(Digital-to-Analog Converter). Aloudspeaker can thenconvert the analog voltage to acoustic wavessothat people can hear sounds.Audio CompressionAudio is often compressed to reduce bandwidth needs and transfer times, eventhough audio data rates are much lower than video data rates.All compressionsystems require twoalgorithms: one is used for compressing the data at the source,'),\n",

Even though we are considering audio first, these asymmetries holdfor video as well.The first asymmetry applies to encoding the source material.Formanyapplications, a multimedia document will only be encoded once (when itis stored on the multimedia server) but will be decoded thousands of times (when itis played back by customers).This asymmetry means that it is acceptable for theencoding algorithm to be slowand require expensive hardware provided that thedecoding algorithm is fast and does not require expensive hardware.The second asymmetry is that the encode/decode process need not be invert-ible. Thatis, when compressing a data file, transmitting it, and then decompress-ing it, the user expects to get the original back, accurate down to the last bit.Withmultimedia, this requirement does not exist. Itis usually acceptable to have theaudio (or video) signal after encoding and then decoding be slightly different fromthe original as long as it sounds (or looks) the same.When the decoded output isnot exactly equal to the original input, the system is said to belossy.Ifthe inputand output are identical, the system islossless.Lossy systems are importantbecause accepting a small amount of information loss normally means a huge pay-offinterms of the compression ratio possible.Manyaudio compression algorithms have been developed. Probablythe mostpopular formats areMP3(MPEG audio layer 3)andAAC(Advanced AudioCoding)ascarried inMP4(MPEG-4)files. Toavoid confusion, note that MPEGprovides audio and video compression. MP3 refers to the audio compression por-tion (part 3) of the MPEG-1 standard, not the third version of MPEG, which hasbeen replaced by MPEG-4.AACisthe successor to MP3 and the default audioencoding used in MPEG-4.

Inwaveform coding,the signalis transformed mathematically by a Fourier transform into its frequencycompo-nents. InChap. 2, we showed an example function of time and its Fourier ampli-tudes in Fig.2-12(a). Theamplitude of each component is then encoded in a mini-mal way.The goal is to reproduce the waveform fairly accurately at the other endin as fewbits as possible.The other way,perceptual coding,exploits certain flaws in the human audi-tory system to encode a signal in such a way that it sounds the same to a human lis-tener,evenifitlooks quite different on an oscilloscope.Perceptual coding is basedon the science ofpsychoacoustics—howpeople perceive sound. BothMP3 andAACare based on perceptual coding.Perceptual encoding dominates modern multimedia systems, so let us takealook at it.Akey property is that some sounds can mask other sounds.Forexam-ple, imagine that you are broadcasting a live flute concert on warm summer day.Then all of a sudden, a crewofworkmen showupwith jackhammers and start tear-ing up the street to replace it. No one can hear the flute anymore, so you can justtransmit the frequencyofthe jackhammers and the listeners will get the samemusical experience as if you also had broadcast the flute as well, and you can savebandwidth to boot.This is calledfrequency masking.When the jackhammers stop, you don’thaveto start broadcasting the flute fre-quencyfor a small period of time because the ear turns down its gain when it picksup a loud sound and it takes a bit of time to reset it. Transmission of low-amplitudesounds during this recovery period are pointless and omitting them can save band-width. This is calledtemporal masking.Perceptual encoding relies heavily on notencoding or transmitting audio that the listeners are not going to perceive anyway.7.4.2 DigitalVideoNowthat we knowall about the ear,itistime to move ontothe eye. (No,thissection is not followed by one on the nose.)The human eye has the property thatwhen an image appears on the retina, the image is retained for some number ofmilliseconds before decaying.If a sequence of images is drawn at 50 images/sec,the eye does not notice that it is looking at discrete images.All video systemssince the Lumière brothers invented the movie projector in 1895 exploit this prin-ciple to produce moving pictures.The simplest digital representation of video is a sequence of frames, each con-sisting of a rectangular grid of picture elements, orpixels.Common sizes forscreens range from 1280× 720 (called720p), 1920× 1080 (called1080porHDvideo), 3840× 2160 (called4K)and 7680× 4320 (called8K).Most systems use 24 bits per pixel, with 8 bits each for the red, blue, and green(RGB) components. Red, blue, and green are the primary additive colors and everyother color can be made from superimposing them in the appropriate intensity.'),\n",

Italso runs at exactly 25.00 frames/sec.During the 1950s, the Commu-nist countries of Eastern Europe adopted SECAM to prevent their people fromwatching West German (PAL) television and getting Bad Ideas.To reduce the amount of bandwidth required to broadcast television signalsoverthe air,television stations adopted a scheme in which frames were dividedinto twofields,one with the odd-numbered rows and one with the even-numberedrows, which were broadcast alternately.This meant that 25 frames/sec was actually50 fields/sec. Thisscheme is calledinterlacing,and givesless flicker than broad-casting entire frames one after another.Modern video does not use interlacing andand just sends entire frames in sequence, usually at 50 frames/sec (PAL) or 59.94frames/sec (NTSC).This is calledprogressive video.Video CompressionIt should be obvious from our discussion of digital video that compression iscritical for sending video overthe Internet.Even 720p PAL progressive videorequires 553 Mbps of bandwidth and HD, 4K, and 8K require a lot more.To pro-duce a standard for compressing video that could be used overall platforms and byall manufacturers, the standards’ committees created a group calledMPEG(Motion PictureExperts Group)tocome up with a worldwide standard.Verybriefly,the standards it came up with, known as MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4,work likethis. Every fewseconds a complete video frame is transmitted.Theframe is compressed using something likethe familiar JPEG algorithm that is usedfor digital still pictures.Then for the next fewseconds, instead of sending out fullframes, the transmitter sends out differences between the current frame and thebase (full) frame it most recently sent out.First let us briefly look at theJPEG(Joint Photographic Experts Group)algorithm for compressing a single still image.Instead of working with the RGBcomponents, it converts the image intoluminance(brightness) andchrominance(color) components because the eye is much more sensitive toluminance thanchrominance, allowing fewer bits to be used to encode the chrominance withoutloss of perceivedimage quality.The image is then broken up into blocks of typi-cally 8× 8or10× 10 pixels, each of which is processed separately.Separately,the'),\n",

The more amplitudes that are discarded, the fuzzierthe image and the smaller the compressed image is.Then standard lossless com-press techniques likerun-length encoding and Huffman encoding are applied to theremaining amplitudes.If this sounds complicated, it is, but computers are prettygood at carrying out complicated algorithms.Nowontothe MPEG part, described belowinasimplified way.The framefollowing a full JPEG (base) frame is likely to be very similar to the JPEG frame,so instead of encoding the full frame, only the blocks that differ from the baseframe are transmitted. A block containing, say,apiece of blue skyislikely to bethe same as it was 20 msec earlier,sothere is no need to transmit it again. Only theblocks that have changed need to be retransmitted.As an example, consider the situation of a a camera mounted securely on a tri-pod with an actor walking toward a stationary tree and house. The first threeframes are shown in Fig.7-32. Theencoding of the second frame just sends theblocks that have changed. Conceptually,the receiverstarts out producing the sec-ond frame by copying the first frame into a buffer and then applying the changes.It then stores the second frame uncompressed for display.Italso uses the secondframe as the base for applying the changes that come describing the differencebetween the third frame and the second one.\\nFigure7-32.Three consecutive frames.It is slightly more complicated than this, though.If a block (say,the actor) ispresent in the second frame but has moved, MPEG allows the encoder to say,ineffect, ‘‘block 29 from the previous frame is present in the newframe offset by adistance (6 x,6 y)and furthermore the sixth pixel has changed toabcand the 24thpixel is nowxyz.’’This allows evenmore compression.We mentioned symmetries between encoding and decoding before. Here wesee one.The encoder can spend as much time as it wants searching for blocks thathave movedand blocks that have changed somewhat to determine whether it is bet-ter to send a list of updates to the previous frame or a complete newJPEG frame.Finding a movedblock is a lot more work than simply copying a block from theprevious image and pasting it into the newone at a known (6 x,6 y)offset.'),\n",

I(Intracoded) frames that are self-contained compressed still images.2. P(Predictive)frames that are difference with thepreviousframe.3. B(Bidirectional) frames that code differences with thenextI-frame.The B-frames require the receivertostop processing until the next I-framearrivesand then work backward from it. Sometimes this givesmore compression,buthaving the encoder constantly check to see if differences with the previousframe or differences with anyone of the next 30, 50, or 80 frames givesthe small-est result is time consuming on the encoding side but not time consuming on thedecoding side. This asymmetry is exploited to the maximum to give the smallestpossible encoded file. TheMPEG standards do not specify howtosearch, howfarto search, or howgood a match has to be in order to send differences or a completenewblock. Thisis up to each implementation.Audio and video are encoded separately as we have described. ThefinalMPEG-encoded file consists of chunks containing some number of compressedimages and the corresponding compressed audio to be played while the frames inthat chunk are displayed. In this way,the video and audio are kept synchronized.Note that this is a rather simplified description. In reality,evenmore tricks areused to get better compression, but the basic ideas givenabove are essentially cor-rect. Themost recent format is MPEG-4, also called MP4.It is formally definedin a standard known as H.264.It’ssuccessor (defined for resolutions up to 8K) isH.265. H.264is the format most consumer video cameras produce. Because thecamera has to record the video on the SD card or other medium in real time, it hasvery little time to hunt for blocks that have movedalittle. Consequently,the com-pression is not nearly as good as what a Hollywood studio can do when it dynam-ically allocates 10,000 computers at a cloud server to encode its latest production.This is encoding/decoding asymmetry in action.7.4.3 Streaming Stored MediaLet us nowmove ontonetwork applications.Our first case is streaming avideo that is already stored on a server somewhere, for example, watching aYouTube or Netflix video.The most common example of this is watching videosoverthe Internet. This is one form ofVoD(Video on Demand). Otherforms ofvideo on demand use a provider network that is separate from the Internet to deliv-er the movies (e.g., the cable TV network).The Internet is full of music and video sites that stream stored multimediafiles. Actually,the easiest way to handle stored media isnotto stream it.Thestraightforward way to makethe video (or music track) available is just to treat the'),\n",

Instep 1, itsends an HTTP request for the movie to the Web server to which the movie is link-ed. Instep 2, the server fetches the movie (which is just a file in MP4 or someother format) and sends it back to the browser.Using the MIME type, the browserlooks up howitissupposed to display the file. Thebrowser then savesthe entiremovie to a scratch file on disk in step 3. It then starts the media player,passing itthe name of the scratch file. Finally,instep 4 the media player starts reading thefile and playing the movie. Conceptually,this is no different than fetching and dis-playing a static Web page, except that the downloaded file is ‘‘displayed’’byusingamedia player instead of just writing pixels to a monitor.In principle, this approach is completely correct.It will play the movie. Thereis no real-time network issue to address either because the download is simply afile download. Theonly trouble is that the entire video must be transmitted overthe network before the movie starts.Most customers do not want to wait an hourfor their ‘‘video on demand’’tostart, so something better is needed.What is needed is a media player that is designed for streaming.It can eitherbe part of the Web browser or an external program called by the browser when avideo needs to be played.Modern browsers that support HTML5 usually have abuilt-in media player.Amedia player has fivemajor jobs to do:1. Managethe user interface.2. Handletransmission errors.3. Decompressthe content.4. Eliminatejitter.5. Decryptthe file.Most media players nowadays have a glitzy user interface, sometimes simulating astereo unit, with shinybuttons, knobs, sliders, and visual displays.Often there are'),\n",

IfaTCP-based transport is being used then there are no errors for the media player tocorrect because TCP already provides reliability by using retransmissions. This isan easy way to handle errors, at least for the media player,but it does complicatethe removalofjitter in a later step because timing out and asking for retransmis-sions introduces uncertain and variable delays in the movie.Alternatively,aUDP-based transport likeRTP can be used to move the data.With these protocols, there are no retransmissions. Thus, packet loss due to con-gestion or transmission errors will mean that some of the media does not arrive.Itis up to the media player to deal with this problem.One way is to ignore the prob-lem and just have bits of video and audio be wrong.If errors are infrequent, thisworks fine and almost no one will notice.Another possibility is to useforwarderror correction,such as encoding the video file with some redundancy, such as aHamming code or a Reed-Solomon code. Then the media player will have enoughinformation to correct errors on its own, without having to ask for retransmissionsor skip bits of damaged movies.The downside here is that adding redundancytothe file makes it bigger.Another approach involves using selective retransmission of the parts of the videostream that are most important to play back the content. For example, in a com-pressed video sequence, a packet loss in an I-frame is much more consequential,since the decoding errors that result from the loss can propagate throughout thegroup of pictures. On the other hand, losses in derivative frames, including P-frames and B-frames, are easier to recoverfrom. Similarly,the value of a retrans-mission also depends on whether the retransmission of the content would arrive intime for playback. As a result, some retransmissions can be far more valuable thanothers, and selectively retransmitting certain packets (e.g., those within I-framesthat would arrive before playback) is one possible strategy.Protocols have beenbuilt on top of RTP and QUIC to provide unequal loss protection when videos arestreamed overUDP (Feamster et al., 2000; and Palmer et al., 2018).The media player’sthird job is decompressing the content.Although this taskis computationally intensive,itisfairly straightforward. Thethornyissue is howtodecode media if the underlying network protocol does not correct transmissionerrors. In manycompression schemes, later data cannot be decompressed until theearlier data has been decompressed, because the later data is encoded relative tothe earlier data.Recall that a P-frame is based upon the most recent I-frame (andother I-frames following it).If the I-frame is damaged and cannot be decoded, allthe subsequent P-frames are useless.The media player will then be forced to waitfor the next I-frame and simply skip a fewseconds of video.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 713}, page_content='690 THE APPLICATION LAYER CHAP.7This reality forces the encoder to makeadecision. If I-frames are spacedclosely,say,one per second, the gap when an error occurs will be fairly small, butthe video will be bigger because I-frames are much bigger than P- or B-frames.IfI-frames are, say,5seconds apart, the video file will be much smaller but there willbe 5-second gap if an I-frame is damaged and a smaller gap if a P-frame is dam-aged. For this reason, when the underlying protocol is TCP,I-frames can be spacedmuch further apart than if RTP is used. Consequently,manyvideo-streaming sitesuse TCP to allowasmaller encoded file with widely spaced I-frames and lessbandwidth needed for smooth playback.The fourth job is to eliminate jitter,the bane of all real-time systems.UsingTCP makes this much worse, because it introduces random delays wheneverretransmissions are needed.The general solution that all streaming systems use isaplayout buffer.before starting to play the video, the system collects 5–30 sec-onds worth of media, as shown in Fig.7-34. Playingdrains media regularly fromthe buffer so that the audio is clear and the video is smooth.The startup delaygivesthe buffer a chance to fill to thelow-water mark.The idea is that datashould nowarrive regularly enough that the buffer is nevercompletely emptied. Ifthat were to happen, the media playout would stall.Buffer\\nLow-watermarkHigh-watermark\\nMediaplayerMediaserverClient machineServer machine\\nFigure7-34.The media player buffers input from the media server and playsfrom the buffer rather than directly from the network.Buffering introduces a newcomplication. Themedia player needs to keep thebuffer partly full, ideally between the low-water mark and the high-water mark.This means when the buffer passes the high-water mark, the player needs to tell thesource to stop sending, lest it lose data for lack of a place to put it.The high-watermark has to be before the end of the buffer because data will continue to stream inuntil theStoprequest gets to the media server.Once the server stops sending andthe pipeline is empty,the buffer will start draining. When it hits the low-watermark, the player sends aStartcommand to the server to start streaming again.By using a protocol in which the media player can command the server to stopand start, the media player can keep enough, but not too much, media in the bufferto ensure smooth playout. Since RAM is fairly cheap these days, a media player,evenonasmartphone, could allocate enough buffer space to hold a minute or moreof media, if need be.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 714}, page_content='SEC. 7.4 STREAMING AUDIO AND VIDEO 691The start-stop mechanism has another nice feature. It decouples the server’stransmission rate from the playout rate. Suppose, for example, that the player hasto play out the video at 8 Mbps. When the buffer drops to the low-water mark, theplayer will tell the server to delivermore data. If the server is capable of deliveringit at 100 Mbps, that is not a problem. It just comes in and is stored in the buffer.When the high-water mark is reached, the player tells the server to stop. In thisway, the server’stransmission rate and the playout rate are completely decoupled.What started out as a real-time system has become a simple nonreal-time file trans-fer system. Getting rid of all the real-time transmission requirements is anotherreason YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming servers use TCP.Itmakes thewhole system design much simpler.Determining the size of the buffer is a bit tricky. Iflots of RAM is available, atfirst glance it sounds likeitmight makesense to have a large buffer and allowtheserver to keep it almost full, just in case the network suffers some congestion lateron. However, users are sometimes finicky. Ifauser finds a scene boring and usesthe buttons on the media player’sinterface to skip forward, that might render mostor all of the buffer useless.In anyevent, jumping forward (or backward) to a spe-cific point in time is unlikely to work unless that frame happens to be an I-frame. Ifnot, the player has to search for a nearby I-frame.If the newplay point is outsidethe buffer,the entire buffer has to be cleared and reloaded.In effect, users whoskip around a lot (and there are manyofthem), waste network bandwidth by invali-dating precious data in their buffers. Systemwide,the existence of users who skiparound a lot argues for limiting the buffer size, evenifthere is plenty of RAMavailable. Ideally,amedia player could observethe user’sbehavior and pick abuffer size to match the user’sviewing style.All commercial videos are encrypted to prevent piracy, somedia players haveto be able to decrypt them as them come in.That is the fifth task in the list above.DASH and HLSThe plethora of devices for viewing media introduces some complications weneed to look at now. Someone who buys a bright, shiny, and very expensive 8Kmonitor will want movies delivered in 7680× 4320 resolution at 100 or 120frames/sec. But if halfway through an exciting movie she has to go to the doctorand wants to finish watching it in the waiting room on a 1280× 720 smartphonethat can handle at most 25 frames/sec, she has a problem.From the streamingsite’spoint of view, this raises the question of what at resolution and frame rateshould movies be encoded.The easy answer is to use every possible combination. At most it wastes diskspace to encode every movie at sevenscreen resolutions (e.g., smartphone, NTSC,PAL, 720p, HD, 4K, and 8K) amd six frame rates (e.g., 25, 30, 50, 60, 100, and120), for a total of 42 variants, but disk space is not very expensive.Abigger,but'),\n",

Thebasic idea is simpleand it is compatible with HTTP (and HTTPS), so it can be streamed on a Webpage. Thestreaming server first encodes its movies at multiple resolutions andframe rates and has them all stored in its disk farm. Eachversion is not stored as asingle file, but as manyfiles, each storing, say,10seconds of video and audio.This would mean that a 90-minute movie with sevenscreen resolutions and sixframe rates (42 variants) would require 42× 540 = 22,680separate files, each with10 seconds worth of content.In other words, each file holds a segment of themovie at one specific resolution and frame rate.Associated with the movie is amanifest, officially known as anMPD(Media Presentation Description), whichlists the names of all these files and their properties, including resolution, framerate, and frame number in the movie.To makethis approach work, both the player and server must both use theDASH protocol.The user side could either be the browser itself, a player shippedto the browser as a JavaScript program, or a custom application (e.g., for a mobiledevice, or a streaming set top box).The first thing it does when it is time to startviewing the movie is fetch the manifest for the movie, which is just a small file, soanormalGETHTTPS request is all that is needed.The player then interrogates the device where it is running to discoverits maxi-mum resolution and possibly other characteristics, such as what audio formats itcan handle and howmanyspeakers it has.Then it begins running some tests bysending test messages to the server to try to estimate howmuch bandwidth is avail-able. Onceit has figured out what resolution the screen has and howmuch band-width is available, the player consults the manifest to find the first, say,10secondsof the movie that givesthe best quality for the screen and available bandwidth.But that’snot the end of the story.Asthe movie plays, the player continues torun bandwidth tests. Every time it needs more content, that is, when the amount ofmedia in the buffer hits the low-water mark, it again consults the manifest andorders the appropriate file depending where it is in the movie and which resolutionand frame rate it wants. If the bandwidth varies wildly during playback, the movieshown may change from 8K at 100 frames/sec to HD at 25 frames/sec and backseveral times a minute.In this way,the system adapts rapidly to changing networkconditions and allows the best viewing experience consistent with the availableresources. Companiessuch as Netflix have published information about howtheyadapt the bitrate of a video stream based on the playback buffer occupancy(Huanget al., 2014).An example is shown in Fig. 7-35.In Fig.7-35, as the bandwidth decreases, the player decides to ask for increas-ingly lowresolution versions. However, itcould also have compromised in otherways. For example, sending out 300 frames for a 10-second playout requires less'),\n",

DASH allows the player to adapt to changing circumstances to give the userthe best possible experience for the current circumstances.The behavior of theplayer and howitrequests segments varies depending on the nature of the playbackservice and the device. Services whose goal is to avoid rebuffering events mightrequests a large number of segments before playing back video and to request seg-ments in batches; other services whose goal is interactivity might fetch DASH seg-ments at a more consistent, steady pace.DASH is still evolving. For example, work is going on to reduce the latency(Le Feuvre et al., 2015), improve the robustness (Wang and Ren, 2019), fairness(Altamini, S., and Shirmohammadi, S, 2019), support virtual reality (Ribezzo etal., 2018), and handle 4K videos well (Quinlan and Sreenan, 2018).DASH is the most common method for streaming video today,although thereare some alternativesworth discussing.Apple’sHLS(HTTP Live Streaming)also works in a browser using HTTP.Itisthe preferred method for viewing videoin Safari on iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and all Apple devices.

HLSworks only with algorithms that Apple supports, but since theseinclude H.264 and H.265, this difference is minor because almost all videos useone of these.DASH allows third parties to easily insert ads into the video stream,which HLS does not.DASH can handle arbitrary digital rights managementschemes, whereas HLS supports only Apple’sown system.DASH is an open official standard, whereas HLS is a proprietary product.Butthat cuts both ways. BecauseHLS has a powerful sponsor behind it, it is availableon manymore platforms than DASH and the implementations are extremely stable.On the other hand, YouTube and Netflix both use DASH. However, DASH is notnatively supported on iOS devices. Most likely the twoprotocols will continue tocoexist for years to come.Video streaming has been a major force driving the Internet for decades. For aretrospective,see Li et al. (2013).An ongoing challenge with streaming video is estimating userQoE(Qualityof Experience)which is, informally,how happyauser is with the performance ofthe video streaming application. Obviously,measuring QoE directly is challenging(it requires asking users about their experience), but network operators are increas-ingly aiming to determine when video streaming applications experience condi-tions that may affect a user’sexperience. Generally speaking, the parameters thatoperators aim to estimate are the startup delay (howlong a video takes to startplaying), the resolution of the video, and anyinstances of stalling (‘‘rebuffering’’).It can be challenging to identify these events in an encrypted video stream, particu-larly for an ISP that does not have access to the client software; machine learningtechniques are increasingly being used to infer application quality from encryptedvideo trafficstreams (Mangla et al., 2018; and Bronzino et al., 2020).7.4.4 Real-Time StreamingIt is not only recorded videos that are tremendously popular on the Web.Real-time streaming is very popular too.Once it became possible to stream audio andvideo overthe Internet, commercial radio and TV stations got the idea of broad-casting their content overthe Internet as well as overthe air.Not so long after that,college stations started putting their signals out overthe Internet.Then collegestu-dentsstarted their own Internet broadcasts.Today,people and companies of all sizes stream live audio and video.

Apodcastis an episode retrievedinthis manner.Streaming live events adds newcomplications to the mix, at least sometimes.Forsports, news broadcasts, and politicians giving long boring speeches, the meth-od of Fig.7-34 still works. When a user logs onto the Web site covering the liveevent, no video is shown for the first fewseconds while the buffer fills. After that,it is the same as watching a movie. The player pulls data out of the buffer,which iscontinuously filled by the feed from the live event. Theonly real difference is thatwhen streaming a movie from a server,the server can potentially load 10 secondsworth of movie in one second if the connection is fast enough. With a live event,that is not possible.Voice overIPAgood example of real-time streaming where buffering is not possible is usingthe Internet to transmit telephone calls (possibly with video, as Skype, FaceTime,and manyother services do).Once upon a time, voice calls were carried overthepublic switched telephone network, and network trafficwas primarily voice traffic,with a little bit of data traffichere and there. Then came the Internet, and the Web.The data trafficgrewand grew, until by 1999 there was as much data trafficasvoice traffic(since voice is nowdigitized, both can be measured in bits). By 2002,the volume of data trafficwas an order of magnitude more than the volume ofvoice trafficand still growing exponentially,with voice trafficstaying almost flat.Nowthe data trafficisorders of magnitude more than the voice traffic.The consequence of this growth has been to flip the telephone network on itshead. Voice trafficisnow carried using Internet technologies, and represents only atinyfraction of the network bandwidth. This disruptive technology is known asvoice overIP,and also asInternet telephony.(As an aside, ‘‘Telephony’’ispro-nounced ‘‘te-LEF-ony.’’)Itisalso called that when the calls include video or aremultiparty,that is, videoconferencing.The biggest difference streaming a movie overthe Internet and Internet tele-phonyisthe need for lowlatency. The telephone network allows a one-waylatencyofupto150 msec for acceptable usage, after which delay begins to be per-ceivedasannoying by the participants.(International calls may have a latencyofup to 400 msec, by which point theyare far from a positive user experience.)'),\n",

This goal means starting with UDP as the clearchoice rather than TCP,because TCP retransmissions introduce at least one round-trip worth of delay.Some forms of latencycannot be reduced, however, evenwith UDP.Forexample, the distance between Seattle and Amsterdam is close to 8,000km. Thespeed-of-light propagation delay for this distance in optical fiber is 40 msec. Goodluck beating that. In practice, the propagation delay through the network will belonger because it will coveralarger distance (the bits do not followagreat circleroute) and have transmission delays as each IP router stores and forwards a packet.This fixed delay eats into the acceptable delay budget.Another source of latencyisrelated to packet size.Normally,large packets arethe best way to use network bandwidth because theyare more efficient. However,at an audio sampling rate of 64 kbps, a 1-KB packet would take125 msec to fill(and evenlonger if the samples are compressed).This delay would consume mostof the overall delay budget. In addition, if the 1-KB packet is sent overabroadbandaccess link that runs at just 1Mbps, it will take8msec to transmit.Then addanother 8 msec for the packet to go overthe broadband link at the other end. Clear-ly,large packets will not work.Instead, voice-over-IP systems use short packets to reduce latencyatthe costof bandwidth efficiency. Theybatch audio samples in smaller units, commonly 20msec. At 64 kbps, this is 160 bytes of data, less with compression. However, bydefinition the delay from this packetization will be 20 msec. The transmissiondelay will be smaller as well because the packet is shorter.Inour example, it wouldreduce to around 1 msec. By using short packets, the minimum one-way delay foraSeattle-to-Amsterdam packet has been reduced from an unacceptable 181 msec(40+ 125+ 16) to an acceptable 62 msec (40+ 20+ 2).We havenot eventalked about the software overhead, but it, too, will eat upsome of the delay budget. This is especially true for video, since compression isusually needed to fit video into the available bandwidth.Unlikestreaming from astored file, there is no time to have a computationally intensive encoder for highlevels of compression.The encoder and the decoder must both run quickly.Buffering is still needed to play out the media samples on time (to avoid unin-telligible audio or jerkyvideo), but the amount of buffering must be kept verysmall since the time remaining in our delay budget is measured in milliseconds.When a packet takes too long to arrive,the player will skip overthe missing sam-ples, perhaps playing ambient noise or repeating a frame to mask the loss to theuser.There is a trade-offbetween the size of the buffer used to handle jitter andthe amount of media that is lost.Asmaller buffer reduces latencybut results inmore loss due to jitter.Eventually,asthe size of the buffer shrinks, the loss willbecome noticeable to the user.'),\n",

The only time that it is not important is when there is somuch network bandwidth that everyone gets good service.In Chap. 5, we described twoquality of service mechanisms that help with thisgoal. Onemechanism is DS (Differentiated Services), in which packets are mark-ed as belonging to different classes that receive different handling within the net-work. Theappropriate marking for voice-over-IP packets is lowdelay.Inpractice,systems set the DS codepoint to the well-known value for theExpedited Forward-ingclass withLow Delaytype of service. This is especially useful overbroadbandaccess links, as these links tend to be congested when Web trafficorother trafficcompetes for use of the link.Givenastable network path, delay and jitter areincreased by congestion.Every 1-KB packet takes 8 msec to send overa1-Mbpslink, and a voice-over-IP packet will incur these delays if it is sitting in a queuebehind Web traffic. However, with a lowdelay marking the voice-over-IP packetswill jump to the head of the queue, bypassing the Web packets and lowering theirdelay.The second mechanism that can reduce delay is to makesure that there is suf-ficient bandwidth. If the available bandwidth varies or the transmission rate fluctu-ates (as with compressed video) and there is sometimes not sufficient bandwidth,queues will build up and add to the delay.This will occur evenwith DS. Toensuresufficient bandwidth, a reservation can be made with the network. This capabilityis provided by integrated services.Unfortunately,itisnot widely deployed. Instead, networks are engineered foran expected trafficlevelornetwork customers are provided with service-levelagreements for a giventrafficlevel. Applications must operate belowthis leveltoavoid causing congestion and introducing unnecessary delays.Forcasual video-conferencing at home, the user may choose a video quality as a proxy for band-width needs, or the software may test the network path and select an appropriatequality automatically.Anyofthe above factors can cause the latencytobecome unacceptable, soreal-time conferencing requires that attention be paid to all of them. For an over-viewofvoice overIPand analysis of these factors, see Sun et al. (2015).Nowthat we have discussed the problem of latencyinthe media streamingpath, we will move ontothe other main problem that conferencing systems mustaddress. This problem is howtoset up and tear down calls.

Toavoid this problem, a number of interested parties gottogether under ITU auspices to work out standards.In 1996, ITU issued recom-mendationH.323,entitled ‘‘Visual Telephone Systems and Equipment for LocalArea Networks Which Provide a Non-Guaranteed Quality of Service.’’ Only thetelephone industry would come up with such a name.After some criticism, It waschanged to ‘‘Packet-based Multimedia Communications Systems’’inthe 1998revision. H.323wasthe basis for the first widespread Internet conferencing sys-tems. It is still widely used.H.323 is more of an architectural overviewofInternet telephonythan a specif-ic protocol.It references a large number of specific protocols for speech coding,call setup, signaling, data transport, and other areas rather than specifying thesethings itself.The general model is depicted in Fig.7-36. Atthe center is agate-waythat connects the Internet to the telephone network.

Theyuse different compression algorithms and makedifferent trade-offsbetween quality and bandwidth.Forvideo, the MPEG forms of video compressionthat we described above are supported, including H.264.Since multiple compression algorithms are permitted, a protocol is needed toallowthe terminals to negotiate which one theyare going to use.This protocol iscalledH.245.Italso negotiates other aspects of the connection such as the bit rate.'),\n",

Thischannel allows terminals to joinand leave the zone, request and return bandwidth, and provide status updates,among other things.Finally,aprotocol is needed for the actual data transmission.RTPoverUDP is used for this purpose.It is managed by RTCP,asusual.

NowthePC registers with the gatekeeper by sending it a RAS message in a UDP packet.After it has been accepted, the PC sends the gatekeeper a RAS admission messagerequesting bandwidth.Only after bandwidth has been granted may call setupbegin. Theidea of requesting bandwidth in advance is to allowthe gatekeeper tolimit the number of calls.It can then avoid oversubscribing the outgoing line inorder to help provide the necessary quality of service.As an aside, the telephone system does the same thing. When you pick up thereceiver, a signal is sent to the local end office. If the office has enough sparecapacity for another call, it generates a dial tone. If not, you hear nothing. Now-adays, the system is so overdimensioned that the dial tone is nearly always instan-taneous, but in the early days of telephony, itoften took a fewseconds.

Callsetup uses existing telephone network protocols, which are connectionoriented, so TCP is needed.In contrast, the telephone system has nothing likeRAS to allowtelephones to announce their presence, so the H.323 designers werefree to use either UDP or TCP for RAS, and theychose the lower-overhead UDP.Nowthat it has bandwidth allocated, the PC can send a Q.931SETUPmessageoverthe TCP connection.This message specifies the number of the telephonebeing called (or the IP address and port, if a computer is being called).The gate-keeper responds with a Q.931CALL PROCEEDINGmessage to acknowledge cor-rect receipt of the request.The gatekeeper then forwards theSETUPmessage tothe gateway.The gateway, which is half computer,half telephone switch, then makes anordinary telephone call to the desired (ordinary) telephone.The end office towhich the telephone is attached rings the called telephone and also sends back aQ.931ALERTmessage to tell the calling PC that ringing has begun. Whenthe per-son at the other end picks up the telephone, the end office sends back a Q.931CONNECTmessage to signal the PC that it has a connection.Once the connection has been established, the gatekeeper is no longer in theloop, although the gatewayis, of course.Subsequent packets bypass the gate-keeper and go directly to the gateway’sIPaddress. Atthis point, we just have abare tube running between the twoparties. Thisis just a physical layer connectionfor moving bits, no more.Neither side knows anything about the other one.The H.245 protocol is nowused to negotiate the parameters of the call.It usesthe H.245 control channel, which is always open.Each side starts out by announc-ing its capabilities, for example, whether it can handle video (H.323 can handlevideo) or conference calls, which codecs it supports, etc.Once each side knowswhat the other one can handle, twounidirectional data channels are set up and acodec and other parameters are assigned to each one.Since each side may havedifferent equipment, it is entirely possible that the codecs on the forward andreverse channels are different. Afterall negotiations are complete, data flowcanbegin using RTP.Itismanaged using RTCP,which plays a role in congestion con-trol.

Consequently,IETF set upacommittee to design a simpler and more modular way to do voice overIP. Themajor result to date isSIP(Session Initiation Protocol). Itis described in RFC3261, with manyupdates since then.This protocol describes howtoset up Internettelephone calls, video conferences, and other multimedia connections.UnlikeH.323, which is a complete protocol suite, SIP is a single module, but it has beendesigned to interwork well with existing Internet applications.Forexample, itdefines telephone numbers as URLs, so that Web pages can contain them, allowingaclick on a link to initiate a telephone call (the same way themailtoscheme allowsaclick on a link to bring up a program to send an email message).SIP can establish two-party sessions (ordinary telephone calls), multiparty ses-sions (where everyone can hear and speak), and multicast sessions (one sender,manyreceivers). Thesessions may contain audio, video, or data, the latter beinguseful for multiplayer real-time games, for example. SIPjust handles setup, man-agement, and termination of sessions.Other protocols, such as RTP/RTCP,arealso used for data transport.SIP is an application-layer protocol and can run overUDP or TCP,asrequired.SIP supports a variety of services, including locating the callee (who may notbe at his home machine) and determining the callee’scapabilities, as well as han-dling the mechanics of call setup and termination.In the simplest case, SIP sets upasession from the caller’scomputer to the callee’scomputer,sowewill examinethat case first.Telephone numbers in SIP are represented as URLs using thesipscheme, forexample,sip:ilse@cs.university.edufor a user named Ilse at the host specified by'),\n",

Inboth cases, the headers on the second and subsequent linesdescribe the structure of the message body,which contains the caller’scapabilities,media types, and formats.If the callee accepts the call, it responds with an HTTP-type reply code (a three-digit number using the groups of Fig.7-26, 200 for accep-tance). Following the reply-code line, the callee also may supply informationabout its capabilities, media types, and formats.Connection is done using a three-way handshake, so the caller responds withanACKmessage to finish the protocol and confirm receipt of the 200 message.Either party may request termination of a session by sending a message withtheBYEmethod. Whenthe other side acknowledges it, the session is terminated.TheOPTIONSmethod is used to query a machine about its own capabilities.It is typically used before a session is initiated to find out if that machine is evencapable of voice overIPorwhatevertype of session is being contemplated.TheREGISTERmethod relates to SIP’sability to track down and connect to auser who is awayfrom home.This message is sent to a SIP location server thatkeeps track of who is where.That server can later be queried to find the user’scur-rent location.The operation of redirection is illustrated in Fig.7-40. Here,the cal-ler sends theINVITEmessage to a proxy server to hide the possible redirection.The proxy then looks up where the user is and sends theINVITEmessage there.Itthen acts as a relay for the subsequent messages in the three-way handshake.

H.323 is a typical, heavyweight, telephone-industry standard, specifying thecomplete protocol stack and defining precisely what is allowed and what is forbid-den. Thisapproach leads to very well-defined protocols in each layer,easing thetask of interoperability.The price paid is a large, complex, and rigid standard thatis difficult to adapt to future applications.In contrast, SIP is a typical Internet protocol that works by exchanging shortlines of ASCII text. Itis a lightweight module that interworks well with otherInternet protocols but less well with existing telephone system signaling protocols.Because the IETF model of voice overIPishighly modular,itisflexible and canbe adapted to newapplications easily.The downside is that is has suffered frominteroperability problems as people try to interpret what the standard means.7.5 CONTENTDELIVERYThe Internet used to be all about point-to-point communication, much likethetelephone network.

For example, ifSally wants to talk to John, she may makeavoice-over-IP call to his mobile.

These networks use data centers spread aroundthe world to servecontent to an extremely large number of clients with good per-formance and availability.The techniques that are used for content distribution have been developed overtime. Earlyin the growth of the Web, its popularity was almost its undoing. Moredemands for content led to servers and networks that were frequently overloaded.Manypeople begantocall the WWW the World Wide Wait. Toreduce the endlessdelays, researchers developed different architectures to use the bandwidth for dis-tributing content.Acommon architecture for distributing content architecture is aCDN(Con-tent Delivery Network), sometimes also called aContent Distribution Network.ACDN is effectively a very large distributed set of caches, which typically servescontent directly to clients. CDNs were once exclusively the purviewofonly thelarge content providers; a content provider with popular content might pay a CDNsuch ask Akamai to distribute their content, effectively prepopulating its cacheswith the content that needed to be distributed. Today,manylarge content providers,including Netflix, Google, and evenmanyISPs that host their own content (e.g.,Comcast) nowoperate their own CDNs.Another way to distribute content is via aP2P(Peer-to-Peer)network, where-by computers servecontent to each other,typically without separately provisionedservers or anycentral point of control. This idea has captured people’simaginationbecause, by acting together,manylittle players can pack an enormous punch.7.5.1 Contentand Internet TrafficTo design and engineer networks that work well, we need an understanding ofthe trafficthat theymust carry.With the shift to content, for example, servers havemigrated from companyoffices to Internet data centers that provide large numbersof machines with excellent network connectivity.Torun evenasmall server now-adays, it is easier and cheaper to rent a virtual server hosted in an Internet data cen-ter than to operate a real machine in a home or office with broadband connectivityto the Internet.Internet trafficishighly skewed. Manyproperties with which we are familiarare clustered around an average. For instance, most adults are close to the averageheight. There are some tall people and some short people, but feware very tall orvery short.Similarly,most novels are a fewhundred pages; very feware 20 pagesor 10,000 pages.Forthese kinds of properties, it is possible to design for a rangethat is not very large but nonetheless captures the majority of the population.'),\n",

Sites are better described as either popular orunpopular.Both kinds of sites matter.The popular sites obviously matter,since afewpopular sites may be responsible for most of the trafficonthe Internet. Perhapssurprisingly,the unpopular sites can matter too. This is because the total amount oftrafficdirected to the unpopular sites can add up to a large fraction of the overalltraffic. The reason is that there are so manyunpopular sites.The notion that, col-lectively,manyunpopular choices can matter has been popularized by books suchasThe Long Tail(Anderson, 2008a).To work effectively in this skewed world, we must be able to build both kindsof Web sites. Unpopular sites are easy to handle. By using DNS, manydifferentsites may actually point to the same computer in the Internet that runs all of thesites. On the other hand, popular sites are difficult to handle. There is no singlecomputer evenremotely powerful enough, and using a single computer wouldmakethe site inaccessible for millions of users when (notif) it fails. Tohandlethese sites, we must build content distribution systems. Wewill start on that questnext.7.5.2 ServerFarms and Web ProxiesThe Web designs that we have seen so far have a single server machine talkingto multiple client machines. Tobuild large Web sites that perform well, we canspeed up processing on either the server side or the client side. On the server side,more powerful Web servers can be built with a server farm, in which a cluster ofcomputers acts as a single server.Onthe client side, better performance can beachievedwith better caching techniques.In particular,proxy caches provide alarge shared cache for a group of clients.We will describe each of these techniques in turn.However, note that neithertechnique is sufficient to build the largest Web sites. Those popular sites requirethe content distribution methods that we describe in the following sections, whichcombine computers at manydifferent locations.ServerFarmsNo matter howmuch computing capacity and bandwidth one machine has, itcan only servesomanyWeb requests before the load is too great.The solution inthis case is to use more than one computer to makeaWeb server.This leads to theserverfarmmodel of Fig. 7-43.'),\n",

Iftheydonot, we have just set up different Web sites that run in parallel.There are several possible solutions to makethe set of servers appear to be oneWebsite. All of the solutions assume that anyofthe servers can handle a requestfrom anyclient. Todothis, each server must have a copyofthe Web site.The ser-vers are shown as connected to a common back-end database by a dashed line forthis purpose.Perhaps the most common solution is to use DNS to spread the requests acrossthe servers in the server farm. When a DNS request is made for the DNS domain inthe corresponding Web URL, the DNS server returns a DNS response that redirectsthe client to a CDN service (typically by a NS-record referral to a name server thatis authoritative for that domain), which in turn aims to return an IP address to theclient that corresponds to a server replica that is close to the client.If multiple IPaddresses are returned in the response, the client typically attempts to connect tothe first IP address in the provided set of responses.The effect is that different cli-ents contact different servers to access the same Web site, just as intended, hope-fully one that is close to the client.Note that this process, which is sometimesreferred to asclient mapping,relies on the authoritative name server to knowthetopological or geographic location for the client. Wewill discuss DNS-based clientmapping in more detail when we describe CDNs.Another popular approach for load balancing today is to useIP anycast.Briefly,IPanycast is the process by which a single IP address can be advertisedfrom multiple different network attachment points (e.g., a network in Europe and anetwork in the United States). If all goes well, a client that seeks to contact a par-ticular IP address would end up having its trafficrouted to the closest network end-point. Of course, as we know, interdomain routing on the Internet doesn’talwayspick the shortest (or eventhe best) path, and so this method is far more coarse-grained and difficult to control than DNS-based client mapping. Nevertheless,'),\n",

The front endis usually a link-layer switch or an IP router,that is, a device that handles frames orpackets. All of the solutions are based on it (or the servers) peeking at the network,transport, or application layer headers and using them in nonstandard ways. AWebrequest and response are carried as a TCP connection.To work correctly,thefront end must distribute all of the packets for a request to the same server.Asimple design is for the front end to broadcast all of the incoming requests toall of the servers. Each server answers only a fraction of the requests by prioragreement. For example, 16 servers might look at the source IP address and replyto the request only if the last 4 bits of the source IP address match their configuredselectors. Other packets are discarded.While this is wasteful of incoming band-width, often the responses are much longer than the request, so it is not nearly asinefficient as it sounds.In a more general design, the front end may inspect the IP,TCP,and HTTPheaders of packets and arbitrarily map them to a server.The mapping is called aload balancingpolicyasthe goal is to balance the workload across the servers.The policymay be simple or complex. A simple policymight be to use the serversone after the other in turn, or round-robin.With this approach, the front end mustremember the mapping for each request so that subsequent packets that are part ofthe same request will be sent to the same server.Also, to makethe site more reli-able than a single server,the front end should notice when servers have failed andstop sending them requests.WebProxiesCaching improvesperformance by shortening the response time and reducingthe network load. If the browser can determine that a cached page is fresh by itself,the page can be fetched from the cache immediately,with no network trafficatall.However, evenifthe browser must ask the server for confirmation that the page isstill fresh, the response time is shortened and the network load is reduced, especial-ly for large pages, since only a small message needs to be sent.However, the best the browser can do is to cache all of the Web pages that theuser has previously visited.From our discussion of popularity,you may recall thatas well as a fewpopular pages that manypeople visit repeatedly,there are many,manyunpopular pages. In practice, this limits the effectiveness of browser cachingbecause there are a large number of pages that are visited just once by a givenuser.These pages always have tobefetched from the server.One strategy to makecaches more effective istoshare the cache among multi-ple users.

Without browser caching, bothusers would need to fetch the page from the server.Ofcourse, this sharing cannotbe done for encrypted traffic, pages that require authentication, and uncacheablepages (e.g., current stock prices) that are returned by programs.Dynamic pagescreated by programs, especially,are a growing case for which caching is not effec-tive.Nonetheless, there are plenty of Web pages that are visible to manyusers andlook the same no matter which user makes the request (e.g., images).AWebproxyis used to share a cache among users.Aproxy is an agent thatacts on behalf of someone else, such as the user.There are manykinds of proxies.Forinstance, an ARP proxy replies to ARP requests on behalf of a user who iselsewhere (and cannot reply for himself).AWeb proxy fetches Web requests onbehalf of its users.It normally provides caching of the Web responses, and since itis shared across users it has a substantially larger cache than a browser.When a proxy is used, the typical setup is for an organization to operate oneWebproxy for all of its users.The organization might be a companyoranISP.Both stand to benefit by speeding up Web requests for its users and reducing itsbandwidth needs. While flat pricing, independent of usage, is common for homeusers, most companies and ISPs are charged according to the bandwidth that theyuse.This setup is shown in Fig.7-44.

One benefit is to filter content. The administrator may configurethe proxy to blacklist sites or otherwise filter the requests that it makes. For exam-ple, manyadministrators frown on employees watching YouTube videos (or worseyet, pornography) on companytime and set their filters accordingly.Another ben-efit of having proxies is privacy oranonymity,when the proxy shields the identityof the user from the server.7.5.3 ContentDelivery NetworksServer farms and Web proxies help to build large sites and to improve Webperformance, but theyare not sufficient for truly popular Web sites that must servecontent on a global scale. For these sites, a different approach is needed.CDNs(Content Delivery Networks)turn the idea of traditional Web cachingon its head.Instead, of having clients look for a copyofthe requested page in anearby cache, provider places a copyofthe page in a set of nodes at different loca-tions and directs the client to use a nearby node as the server.The techniques for using DNS for content distribution were pioneered by Aka-mai starting in 1998, when the Web was groaning under the load of its earlygrowth. Akamai was the first major CDN and soon became the industry leader.Probably evenmore cleverthan the idea of using DNS to connect clients to nearbynodes was the model and incentive structure of its business. Companies pay Aka-mai to delivertheir content to clients, so that theyhaveresponsive Web sites thatcustomers liketouse. The CDN nodes must be placed at network locations withgood connectivity,which initially meant inside ISP networks. Inpractice a CDNnode consists of a standard 19-inch equipment rack containing a computer and alot of disks, with an optical fiber coming out of it to connect to the ISP’sinternalLAN.Forthe ISPs, there is a benefit to having a CDN node in their networks, namelythat the CDN node cuts down the amount of upstream network bandwidth that theyneed (and must pay for).In addition, the CDN node reduces latencytothe contentthe ISP’scustomers, Thus, the content provider,the ISP,and the customers all ben-efit and the CDN makes money.

Asmentioned, manylarge contentproviders such as YouTube, Facebook, and Netflix operate their own CDNs.The largest CDNs have hundreds of thousands of servers deployed in countriesall overthe world. Thislarge capacity can also help Web sites defend againstDDoS attacks.If an attacker manages to send hundreds or thousands of requestsper second to a site that uses a CDN, there is a good chance that the CDN will beable to reply to them all.In this way,the attacked site will be able to survive theflood of requests.That is, the CDN can quickly scale up a site’sserving capacity.Some CDNs evenadvertise their ability to handle large-scale DDoS attacks as aselling point to attract content providers.The CDN nodes pictured in our example are normally clusters of machines.DNS redirection is done with twolevels: one to map clients to the approximatenetwork location, and another to spread the load overnodes in that location. Bothreliability and performance are concerns.To beable to shift a client from onemachine in a cluster to another,DNS replies at the second levelare givenwithshort TTLs so that the client will repeat the resolution after a short while.Finally,while we have concentrated on distributing static objects likeimages and videos,CDNs can also support dynamic page creation, streaming media, and more.CDNsare also commonly used to distribute video.Populating CDN Cache NodesAn example of the path that data follows when it is distributed by a CDN isshown in Fig.7-45. Itis a tree. The origin server in the CDN distributes a copyofthe content to other nodes in the CDN, in Sydney, Boston, and Amsterdam, in thisexample. This is shown with dashed lines.Clients then fetch pages from the‘‘nearest’’node in the CDN. This is shown with solid lines.In this way,the clientsin Sydneyboth fetch the page copythat is stored in Sydney; theydonot both fetchthe page from the origin server,which may be in Europe.Using a tree structure has three advantages. First,the content distribution canbe scaled up to as manyclients as needed by using more nodes in the CDN, andmore levels in the tree when the distribution among CDN nodes becomes the bot-tleneck. No matter howmanyclients there are, the tree structure is efficient. Theorigin server is not overloaded because it talks to the manyclients via the tree ofCDN nodes; it does not have toanswer each request for a page by itself.Second,each client gets good performance by fetching pages from a nearby server insteadof a distant server.This is because the round-trip time for setting up a connection isshorter,TCP slow-start ramps up more quickly because of the shorter round-triptime, and the shorter network path is less likely to pass through regions of conges-tion in the Internet.Finally,the total load that is placed on the network is also keptat a minimum. If the CDN nodes are well placed, the trafficfor a givenpageshould pass overeach part of the network only once. This is important becausesomeone pays for network bandwidth, eventually.'),\n",

This DNS lookup proceeds in the usualmanner.Byusing the DNS protocol, the browser learns the IP address of the nameserver forcdn.com,then contacts the name server to ask it to resolvewww.cdn.com.At this point, however, because the name server is run by the CDN.instead ofreturning the same IP address for each request, it will look at the IP address of theclient making the request and return different answers depending on where the cli-ent is located. The answer will be the IP address of the CDN node that is nearest tothe client.That is, if a client in Sydneyasks the CDN name server to resolvewww.cdn.com,the name server will return the IP address of the SydneyCDN node,butifaclient in Amsterdam makes the same request, the name server will returnthe IP address of the Amsterdam CDN node instead.This strategy is perfectly appropriate, according to the semantics of DNS. Wehave previously seen that name servers may return changing lists of IP addresses.After the name resolution, the Sydneyclient will fetch the page directly from theSydneyCDN node.Further pages on the same ‘‘server’’will be fetched directlyfrom the SydneyCDN node as well because of DNS caching.The overallsequence of steps is shown in Fig. 7-46.CDN originserver\\n2: Query DNSCDN DNSserver\\nAmsterdamCDN nodeSydneyCDN node\\n3: “Contact Sydney”“Contact Amsterdam”\\n4: Fetchpage1: Distribute content\\nSydney clients Amsterdam clientsFigure7-46.Directing clients to nearby CDN nodes using DNS.Acomplexquestion in the above process is what it means to find the nearestCDN node, and howtogoabout it (this is theclient mappingproblem that we dis-cussed earlier).There are at least twofactors to consider in mapping a client to aCDN node.

Ifthe CDN nodes are overloaded, theywill deliverslowresponses, just liketheoverloaded Web server that we sought to avoid in the first place. Thus, it may benecessary to balance the load across the CDN nodes, mapping some clients tonodes that are slightly further awaybut more lightly loaded.The ability of a CDN’sauthoritative DNS server to map a client to a nearbyCDN cache node depends on the ability to determine the client’slocation. As pre-viously discussed in the DNS section, modern extensions to DNS, such as EDNS0Client Subnet makeitpossible for the authoritative name server to see the client’sIP address. The potential move toDNS-over-HTTPS also may introduce newchal-lenges, giventhat the IP address of the local recursive resolver may be nowherenear the client; if the DNS local recursive does not pass on the IP address of theclient (as is typically the case, giventhat the whole purpose is to preservethe pri-vacy ofthe client), then CDNs who do not also resolveDNS for their clients arelikely to face greater difficulties in performing client mapping.On the other hand,CDNs who also operate a DoH resolver (as Cloudflare and Google nowdo) mayreap significant benefits, as theywill have direct knowledge of the client IP addres-ses that are issuing DNS queries, often for content on their own CDNs!

There aremanymore details that matter in practice.Forexample, the CDN nodes’ disks willeventually fill up so theyhaveto purged regularly.Much work has been done ondetermining on which files to discard and when, for example Basu et al.

It is a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) network.P2P networks burst onto the scene starting in 1999.The first widespreadapplication was for mass crime: 50 million Napster users were exchanging copy-righted songs without the copyright owners’ permission until Napster was shutdown by the courts amid great controversy.Nevertheless, peer-to-peer technologyhas manyinteresting and legaluses.

Today,BitTorrent remains the most popular P2P protocol. It is used so widely to share(licensed and public domain) videos, as well as other large content (e.g., operatingsystem disk images), that it still accounts for a significant fraction of all Internettraffic, despite the growth of video. Wewill look at it later in this section.OverviewThe basic idea of aP2P(Peer-to-Peer)file-sharing network is that manycom-puters come together and pool their resources to form a content distribution sys-tem. The computers are often simply home computers. Theydonot need to bemachines in Internet data centers.The computers are calledpeersbecause eachone can alternately act as a client to another peer,fetching its content, and as a ser-ver, providing content to other peers.What makes peer-to-peer systems interestingis that there is no dedicated infrastructure, unlikeinaCDN. Everyone participatesin the task of distributing content, and there is often no central point of control.Manyuse cases exist (Karagiannis et al., 2019).Manypeople are excited about P2P technology because it is seen as empow-ering the little guy.The reason is not only that it takes a large companytorun aCDN, while anyone with a computer can join a P2P network. It is that P2P net-works have a formidable capacity to distribute content that can match the largest ofWebsites.Early Peer-to-Peer Networks: NapsterAs previously discussed, early peer-to-peer networks such as Napster werebased on a centralized directory service. Users installed client software that scanedtheir local storage for files to share and, after inspecting the contents, uploadedmetadata information about the shared files (e.g., file names, sizes, identity of theuser sharing the content) to a centralized directory service. Users who wished toretrieve files from the Napster network would subsequently search the centralizeddirectory server and could learn about other users who had that file. The serverwould inform the user searching for content about the IP address of a peer that wassharing the file that the user was looking for,atwhich point the user’sclient soft-ware could contact that host directly and download the file in question.Aside-effect of Napster’scentralized directory server was that it made it rel-atively easy for others to search the network and exhaustively determine who wassharing which files, effectively crawling the entire network. It became clear atsome point that a significant fraction of all content on Napster was copyrightedmaterial, which ultimately resulted in injunctions that shut the service down.Another side-effect of the centralized directory service that became clear was thatto disable the service, one needed only to disable the directory server.Without it,Napster became effectively unusable. In response, designers of newpeer-to-peer'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 740}, page_content='SEC. 7.5 CONTENT DELIVERY 717networks begantodesign systems that could be more robust to shutdown or failure.The general approach to doing so was to decentralize the directory or search proc-ess. Next-generation peer-to-peer systems, such as Gnutella, took this approach.Decentralizing the Directory: GnutellaGnutella was released in 2000; it attempted to solvesome of the problems thatacentralized directory service that Napster suffered from, effectively by imple-menting a fully distributed search function.In Gnutella, a peer that joined the net-work would attempt to discoverother connected peers through an ad hoc discoveryprocess; the peer would start by contacting a fewwell-known Gnutella peers whichit had to discoverthrough some bootstrapping process.One way of doing so wasto ship some set of IP addresses of Gnutella peers with the software itself. Upondiscovering a set of peers, the Gnutella peer could then issue search queries tothese neighboring peers, who would then pass the query on to their neighbors, andso forth.This general approach to searching a peer-to-peer network is oftenreferred to asgossip.Although the gossip approach solved some of the problems faced bysemi-centralized services such as Napster,itquickly faced other problems.Oneproblem is that in the Gnutella network, peers were continually joining and leavingthe network; peers were simply other users’ computers, and thus theywere contin-ually entering and leaving the network. In particular,users had no particular reasonto stay on the network after retrieving the files that theywere interested in, andthus so calledfree-ridingbehavior was common, with 70% of the users contribut-ing no content (Adar and Huberman, 2000). Second, the flooding-based Specifi-cally,the gossip approach scaled very poorly,particularly as Gnutella became pop-ular.Specifically,the number of gossip messages grewexponentially with thenumber of participants in the network. The protocol thus scaled particularly poorly.Users with limited network capacity basically found the network completely unus-able. Gnutella’sintroduction of so-calledultra-peersmitigated these scalabilitychallenges somewhat, but in general Gnutella was fairly wasteful of available net-work resources.The lack of scalability in Gnutella’slookup process inspired theinvention ofDHTs(Distributed Hash Tables)whereby a lookup is routed to theappropriate a peer-to-peer network based on the corresponding hash value of thelookup; each node in the peer-to-peer network is responsible only for maintaininginformation about some subset of the overall lookup space, and the DHT is respon-sible for routing the query to the appropriate peer that can resolvethe lookup.DHTs are used in manymodern peer-to-peer networks, including eDonkey (whichuses a DHT for lookup) and BitTorrent (which uses a DHT to scale the tracking ofpeers in the network, as we describe in the next section).Finally,Gnutella did not automatically verify file contents that users weredownloading, resulting in a significant amount of bogus content on the network.Whywould a peer-to-peer network have somuch fakecontent, you might wonder.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 741}, page_content='718 THE APPLICATION LAYER CHAP.7There are manypossible reasons. One simple reason is that, just as anyInternetservice might be subject to a denial-of-service attack, Gnutella itself also became atarget, and one of the easiest ways to launch a denial of service attack on the net-work was to mount so-calledpollution attacks,which flooded the network withfake content. Onegroup that was particularly interested in rendering these net-works useless was the recording industry (notably the Recording Industry Associa-tion of America), who was found to be polluting peer-to-peer networks such asGnutella with large amounts of fakecontent to dissuade people from using the net-works to exchange copyrighted content.Thus, peer-to-peer networks were faced with a number of challenges: scaling,convincing users to stick around after downloading the content theywere searchingfor,and verifying the content theydownloaded. BitTorrent’sdesign addressed allthree challenges, as we discuss next.Coping with Scaling, Incentives, and Verification: BitTorrentThe BitTorrent protocol was developed by Bram Cohen in 2001 to let a set ofpeers share files quickly and easily.There are dozens of freely available clientsthat speak this protocol, just as there are manybrowsers that speak the HTTP pro-tocol to Web servers. The protocol is available as an open standard atbittor-rent.org.In a typical peer-to-peer system, likethat formed with BitTorrent, the userseach have some information that may be of interest to other users.This infor-mation may be free software, music, videos, photographs, and so on. There arethree problems that need to be solved to share content in this setting:1. Howdoes a peer find other peers that have the content it wants todownload?2. Howiscontent replicated by peers to provide high-speed downloadsfor everyone?3. Howdopeers encourage each other to upload content to others aswell as download content for themselves?The first problem exists because not all peers will have all of the content. Theapproach taken in BitTorrent is for every content provider to create a contentdescription called atorrent.The torrent is much smaller than the content, and isused by a peer to verify the integrity of the data that it downloads from other peers.Other users who want to download the content must first obtain the torrent, say,byfinding it on a Web page advertising the content.The torrent is just a file in a specified format that contains twokey kinds ofinformation. One kind is the name of a tracker,which is a server that leads peers tothe content of the torrent.The other kind of information is a list of equal-sized'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 742}, page_content='SEC. 7.5 CONTENT DELIVERY 719pieces, orchunks,that makeupthe content.In early versions of BitTorrent, thetracker was a centralized server; as with Napster,centralizing the tracker resultedin a single point of failure for a BitTorrent network. As a result, modern versions ofBitTorrent commonly decentralize the tracker functionality using a DHT.Differentchunk sizes can be used for different torrents; theytypically range from 64KB to512 KB.The torrent file contains the name of each chunk, givenasa160-bitSHA-1 hash of the chunk.We will covercryptographic hashes such as SHA-1 inChap. 8. For now, you can think of a hash as a longer and more secure checksum.Giventhe size of chunks and hashes, the torrent file is at least three orders of mag-nitude smaller than the content, so it can be transferred quickly.To download the content described in a torrent, a peer first contacts the trackerfor the torrent. Thetrackeris a server (or group of servers, organized by a DHT)that maintains a list of all the other peers that are actively downloading and upload-ing the content.This set of peers is called aswarm.The members of the swarmcontact the tracker regularly to report that theyare still active,aswell as when theyleave the swarm. Whenanew peer contacts the tracker to join the swarm, thetracker tells it about other peers in the swarm. Gettingthe torrent and contactingthe tracker are the first twosteps for downloading content, as shown in Fig. 7-47.\\nSeedpeer\\nUnchokedpeers\\nTracker\\nTorrent\\nPeer\\n1: Get torrentmetafile\\n2: Get peersfrom tracker3: Trade chunkswith peers Source ofcontent\\nFigure7-47.BitTorrent.The second problem is howtoshare content in a way that givesrapid down-loads. When a swarm is first formed, some peers must have all of the chunks thatmakeupthe content. These peers are calledseeders.Other peers that join theswarm will have nochunks; theyare the peers that are downloading the content.While a peer participates in a swarm, it simultaneously downloads chunks thatit is missing from other peers, and uploads chunks that it has to other peers whoneed them.This trading is shown as the last step of content distribution inFig. 7-47.Over time, the peer gathers more chunks until it has downloaded all ofthe content. The peer can leave the swarm (and return) at anytime. Normally a'),\n",

With peers com-ing and going, the rate of churn in a swarm can be quite high.Forthe above method to work well, each chunk should be available at manypeers. If everyone were to get the chunks in the same order,itislikely that manypeers would depend on the seeders for the next chunk. This would create a bottle-neck. Instead,peers exchange lists of the chunks theyhavewith each other.Thentheypreferentially select rare chunks that are hard to find to download. Theidea isthat downloading a rare chunk will result in the creation of another copyofit,which will makethe chunk easier for other peers to find and download. If all peersdo this, after a short while all chunks will be widely available.The third problem involves incentives. CDNnodes are set up exclusively toprovide content to users.P2P nodes are not. Theyare users’ computers, and theusers may be more interested in getting a movie than helping other users with theirdownloads; in other words, there can sometimes be incentivesfor users to cheat thesystem. Nodesthat takeresources from a system without contributing in kind arecalledfree-ridersorleechers.Ifthere are too manyofthem, the system will notfunction well. Earlier P2P systems were known to host them (Saroiu et al., 2003)so BitTorrent sought to minimize them.BitTorrent attempts to address this problem by rewarding peers who showgood upload behavior.Each peer randomly samples the other peers, retrievingchunks from them while it uploads chunks to them.The peer continues to tradechunks with only a small number of peers that provide the highest download per-formance, while also randomly trying other peers to find good partners. Randomlytrying peers also allows newcomers to obtain initial chunks that theycan trade withother peers.The peers with which a node is currently exchanging chunks are saidto beunchoked.Over time, this algorithm aims to match peers with comparable upload anddownload rates with each other.The more a peer is contributing to the other peers,the more it can expect in return. Using a set of peers also helps to saturate a peer’sdownload bandwidth for high performance.Conversely,ifapeer is not uploadingchunks to other peers, or is doing so very slowly,itwill be cut off, orchoked,sooner or later.This strategy discourages adversarial behavior in which peers free-ride on the swarm.The choking algorithm is sometimes described as implementing thetit-for-tatstrategy that encourages cooperation in repeated interactions; the theory behind theincentivesfor cooperation are rooted in the famous tit-for-tat game in game theory,whereby players have incentivestocheat unless (1) theyrepeatedly play the gamewith each other (as is the case in BitTorrent, where peers must repeatedly swapchunks) and (2) peers are punished for not cooperating (as is the case with chok-ing). Despitethis design, in actual practice BitTorrent does not prevent clientsfrom gaming the system in various ways (Piatek et al., 2007).Forexample, Bit-Torrent’salgorithm whereby a client favors selecting rare pieces can create incen-tivesfor a peer to lie about which chunks of the file it has (e.g., claiming that it has'),\n",

Software also exists wherebyclients can lie to the tracker about its ratio of upload to download, effectively say-ing that it performed uploads that it did not perform. For these reasons, it is criticalfor a peer to verify each chunk that theydownload from other peers. It can do so bycomparing the SHA-1 hash value of each chunk that is present in the torrent fileagainst the corresponding SHA-1 hash value that theycan compute for each cor-responding chunk that it downloads.Another challenge involves creating incentivesfor peers to stay around in theBitTorrent swarm as seeders, evenafter theyhavecompleted downloading theentire file. If theydonot, then the possibility exists that nobody in the swarm hasthe entire file, and (worse), that a swarm may collectively be missing pieces of theentire file, thus making it impossible for anyone to download the complete file.This problem is particularly acute for files that are less popular (Menasche et al.,2013). Various approaches have been developed to address these incentive issues(Ramachandran et al., 2007).As you can see from our discussion, BitTorrent comes with a rich vocabulary.There are torrents, swarms, leechers, seeders, and trackers, as well as snubbing,choking, lurking, and more.Formore information see the short paper on BitTor-rent (Cohen, 2003).7.5.5 Evolution of the InternetAs we described in Chap. 1, the Internet has had a strange history,starting asan academic research project for a fewdozen American universities with an ARPAcontract. It is evenhard to define the moment it began. Was that Nov. 21, 1969,when twoARPANET nodes, UCLA and SRI, were connected?WasitonDec. 17,1972 when the Hawaiian AlohaNet connected to the ARPANET to form an inter-network? Was it Jan. 1, 1983, when ARPAofficially adopted TCP/IP as the proto-col? Was it in 1989, when Tim Berners-Lee proposed what is nowthe World WideWeb? Itis hard to say.What is easy to say,however, isthat a huge amount haschanged since the early days of the ARPANET and fledgling Internet, much of itdo the widespread adoption of CDNs and cloud computing.Belowwewill takeaquick look.The fundamental model behind the ARPANET and the early Internet is shownin Fig. 7-48.It consists of three components:1. Hosts(the computers that did the work for the users).2. Routers(called IMPs in the ARPANET) that switched the packets.3. Transmission lines (originally 56-kbps leased telephone lines).Each router was connected to one or more computers.The conceptual model of the early Internet architecture was dominated by thebasic idea of point-to-point communications.The host computers were all seen as'),\n",

With the introduction of TCP/IP these were all 32 bits, which at the timeseemed likeanexcellent approximation to infinity.Now itseems closer to zerothan to infinity.The transmission model was that of a simple stateless, datagramsystem, with each packet containing its destination address. Once a packet passedthrough a router,itwas completely forgotten. Routing was done hop by hop. Eachpacket was routed based on its destination address and information in the router’stables about which transmission line to use for the packet’sdestination.Things begantochange when the Internet surged past its academic beginningsand went commercial.That led to the development of the backbone networks,which used very high-speed links and were operated by large telecom companieslikeAT&T and Verizon. Each companyran its own backbone, but the companiesconnected to each other at peering exchanges. Internetservice providers sprung upto connect homes and businesses to the Internet and regional networks connectedthe ISPs to the backbones. This situation is shown in Fig.1-17. Thenext step wasthe introduction of national ISPs and CDNs, as shown in Fig. 1-18.Cloud computing and very large CDNs have again disrupted the structure ofthe Internet, much as we described in Chap. 1.Modern cloud data centers, likethose run by Amazon and Microsoft, have hundreds of thousands of computers inthe same building, allowing users (typically large companies) to allocate 100 or1000 or 10,000 machines within seconds.

Asaside benefit, as mentioned above,clouds also pro-vide fairly good protection against DDoS attacks because the cloud is so big that itcan absorb thousands of requests/sec, answer them all, and keep on functioning,thus defeating the intent of the DDoS attack.CDNs are hierarchical, with a master site (possibly replicated twoorthreetimes for reliability) and manycaches all overthe world to which content ispushed. When a user requests content, it is served from the closest cache.Thisreduces latencyand spreads the workload. Akamai, the first large commercialCDN, has over200,000 cache nodes in more than 1500 networks in more than 120countries. Similarly,Cloudflare nowhas cache nodes in more than 90 countries.In manycases, CDN cache nodes are co-located with ISP offices, so data can travelfrom the CDN to the ISP overavery fast piece of optical fiber perhaps only 5meters long.This newworld has led to the Internet architecture shown inFig. 7-49,where the vast majority of Internet trafficiscarried between access (e.g.,regional) networks and distributed cloud infrastructure (i.e., either CDNs or cloudservices).Users send requests to large servers to do something and the server does it andcreates a Web page showing what it did.Examples of requests are:1. Buyaproduct at an e-commerce store.2. Fetchan email message from an email provider.3. Issueapayment order to a bank.4. Requestasong or movie to be streamed to a user’sdevice.5. UpdateaFacebook page.6. Askan online newspaper to display an article.Nearly all Internet traffictoday nowfollows this model. The proliferation of cloudservices and CDNs have upended the conventional client-server model of Internettraffic, whereby a client would retrieve orexchange content with a single server.Today,the vast majority of content and communications operates on distributedcloud services; manyaccess ISPs for example send the majority of their traffictodistributed cloud services. In most developed regions, there is simply no need forusers to access massive amounts of content overlong-haul transit infrastructure:CDNs have byand large placed much of that popular content close to the user,often geographically nearby and across a direct network interconnect to theiraccess ISP.Thus an increasing amount of content is delivered via CDNs that are'),\n",

The AMS-IXexchange in Amsterdam and the LINX exchange in London each connect about1,000 networks. Thelarger exchanges in the United States each connect hundredsof networks.

Oneexample of this is Akamai, which has over200,000 servers, most inside ISP net-works, as mentioned above.This trend will continue to reshape the Internet inyears to come.

Every nightall the machines downloaded this file. Butwhen the ARPANET morphed into theInternet and exploded in size, a far more sophisticated and dynamic namingscheme was required.The one used nowisahierarchical approach called theDomain Name System.It organizes all the machines on the Internet into a set oftrees. Atthe top levelare the well-known generic domains, includingcomandedu,aswell as about 200 country domains.DNS is implemented as a distributeddatabase with servers all overthe world. Byquerying a DNS server,aprocess canmap an Internet domain name onto the IP address used to communicate with acomputer for that domain.DNS is used for a variety of purposes; recent develop-ments have created privacy concerns around DNS, resulting in a move toencryptDNS with TLS or HTTPS. The resulting potential centralization of DNS is poisedto change fundamental aspects of the Internet architecture.Email is the original killer app of the Internet.It is still widely used by every-one from small children to grandparents.Most email systems in the world use themail system nowdefined in RFC 5321 and RFC 5322.Messages have simpleASCII headers, and manykinds of content can be sent using MIME.Mail is sub-mitted to message transfer agents for delivery and retrievedfrom them for pres-entation by a variety of user agents, including Web applications.Submitted mail isdelivered using SMTP,which works by making a TCP connection from the send-ing message transfer agent to the receiving one.The Web is the application that most people think of as being the Internet.Originally,itwas a system for seamlessly linking hypertext pages (written inHTML) across machines.The pages are downloaded by making a TCP connectionfrom the browser to a server and using HTTP.Nowadays, much of the content onthe Web is produced dynamically,either at the server (e.g., with PHP) or in thebrowser (e.g., with JavaScript). When combined with back-end databases, dynamicserver pages allowWeb applications such as e-commerce and search.Dynamicbrowser pages are evolving into full-featured applications, such as email, that runinside the browser and use the Web protocols to communicate with remote servers.With the growth of the advertising industry,tracking on the Web has become verypervasive,through a variety of techniques, from cookies to canvasfingerprinting.'),\n",

Themajority of Internet traffictoday is video. Much of it is streamed from Web sitesoveramix of protocols although TCP is also very widely used. Live media isstreamed to manyconsumers. It includes Internet radio and TV stations that broad-cast all manner of events. Audio and video are also used for real-time conferenc-ing. Manycalls use voice overIP, rather than the traditional telephone network,and include videoconferencing.There are a small number of tremendously popular Web sites, as well as a verylarge number of less popular ones. Toservethe popular sites, content distributionnetworks have been deployed. CDNs use DNS to direct clients to a nearby server;the servers are placed in data centers all around the world. Alternatively,P2P net-works let a collection of machines share content such as movies among them-selves. Theyprovide a content distribution capacity that scales with the number ofmachines in the P2P network and which can rivalthe largest of sites.\\nPROBLEMS1.Manybusiness computers have three distinct and worldwide unique identifiers.

Inthis chapter,wewillstudy network security from several angles, point out numerous pitfalls, and dis-cuss manyalgorithms and protocols for making networks more secure.On a historical note, network hacking already existed long before there was anInternet. Instead, the telephone network was the target and messing around withthe signaling protocol was known asphone phreaking.Phone phreaking startedin the late 1950s, and really took offinthe 1960s and 1970s. In those days, thecontrol signals used to authorize and route calls, were still ‘‘in band’’: the phonecompanyused sounds at specific frequencies in the same channel as the voice com-munication to tell the switches what to do.One of the best-known phone phreakers isJohn Draper,acontroversial figurewho found that the toywhistle included in the boxes of Cap’n Crunch cereals inthe late 1960s emitted a tone of exactly 2600 Hz which happened to be the fre-quencythat AT&T used to authorize long-distance calls.

Securityadditionally deals with the problems of legitimate messages beingcaptured and replayed, and with people later trying to denythat theysent certainmessages.Most security problems are intentionally caused by malicious people trying togain some benefit, get attention, or harm someone.Afew ofthe most commonperpetrators are listed in Fig.8-1. Itshould be clear from this list that making anetwork secure involves a lot more than just keeping it free of programming errors.It involves outsmarting often intelligent, dedicated, and sometimes well-fundedadversaries. Measuresthat will thwart casual attackers will have little impact onthe serious ones.In an article inUSENIX ;Login:,James Mickens of Microsoft (and nowapro-fessor at Harvard University) argued that you should distinguish between everydayattackers and, say,sophisticated intelligence services. If you are worried aboutgarden-variety adversaries, you will be fine with common sense and basic securitymeasures. Mickens eloquently explains the distinction:‘‘If your adversary is the Mossad, you’re gonna die and there’snothing that youcan do about it.The Mossad is not intimidated by the fact that you employhttps://.If the Mossad wants your data, they’re going to use a drone to replace your cell-phone with a piece of uranium that’sshaped likeacellphone,and when you die oftumorsfilled with tumors, they’re going to hold a press conference and say ‘‘Itwasn’tus’’astheywear t-shirts that say ‘‘IT WAS DEFINITELYUS’’and thenthey’re going to buy all of your stuffatyour estate sale so that theycan directlylook at the photos of your vacation instead of reading your insipid emails aboutthem.’’Mickens’ point is that sophisticated attackers have advanced means to compro-mise your systems and stopping them is very hard.In addition, police recordsshowthat the most damaging attacks are often perpetrated by insiders bearing agrudge.

Goodexamples of attempts to compromise availability are the denial-of-service attacksthat frequently wreak havoconhigh-value targets such as banks, airlines and thelocal high school during exam time.In addition to the classic triumvirate of confi-dentiality,integrity,and availability that dominates the security domain, there areother issues that play important roles also.In particular,authenticationdeals withdetermining whom you are talking to before revealing sensitive information orentering into a business deal.Finally,nonrepudiationdeals with signatures: howdo you prove that your customer really placed an electronic order for 10 millionleft-handed doohickeysat89cents each when he later claims the price was 69cents? Ormaybe he claims he neverplaced anyorder after seeing that a Chinesefirm is flooding the market with left-handed doohickeysfor 49 cents.All these issuesoccur in traditional systems, too, but with some significantdifferences.

Noneof these optionsare available electronically.Clearly,other solutions are needed.Before getting into the solutions themselves, it is worth spending a fewmoments considering where in the protocol stack network security belongs.Thereis probably no one single place.Every layer has something to contribute. Inthephysical layer,wiretapping can be foiled by enclosing transmission lines (or betteryet, optical fibers) in sealed metal tubes containing an inert gas at high pressure.Anyattempt to drill into a tube will release some gas, reducing the pressure andtriggering an alarm.Some military systems use this technique.In the data link layer,packets on a point-to-point link can be encrypted as theyleave one machine and decrypted as theyenter another.All the details can behandled in the data link layer,with higher layers oblivious to what is going on.This solution breaks down when packets have totraverse multiple routers, howev-er,because packets have tobedecrypted at each router,leaving them vulnerable toattacks from within the router.Also, it does not allowsome sessions to be protect-ed (e.g., those involving online purchases by credit card) and others not.Neverthe-less,link encryption,asthis method is called, can be added to anynetwork easilyand is often useful.In the network layer,firewalls can be deployed to prevent attack trafficfromentering or leaving networks. IPsec,aprotocol for IP security that encrypts packetpayloads, also functions at this layer.Atthe transport layer,entire connections canbe encrypted end-to-end, that is, process to process.Problems such as userauthentication and nonrepudiation are often handled at the application layer,although occasionally (e.g., in the case of wireless networks), user authenticationcan takeplace at lower layers.Since security applies to all layers of the networkprotocol stack, we dedicate an entire chapter of the book to this topic.8.1.1 FundamentalSecurity PrinciplesWhile addressing security concerns in all layers of the network stack is cer-tainly necessary,itisvery difficult to determine when you have addressed themsufficiently and if you have addressed them all. In other words,guaranteeingsecu-rity is hard. Instead, we try to improve security as much as we can by consistentlyapplying a set of security principles. Classic security principles were formulated asearly as 1975 by Jerome Saltzer and Michael Schroeder:'),\n",

Moreover, users may not under-stand them well and use them in a wrong or insecure way.Simple sys-tems are good systems.Forinstance, PGP (Pretty Good Privacy,seeSec. 8.11), offers powerful protection for email. However, manyusers find it cumbersome in practice and so far it has not yet gainedvery widespread adoption. Simplicity also helps to minimize theattack surface(all the points where an attacker may interact with thesystem to try to compromise it). A system that offers a large set offunctions to untrusted users, each implemented by manylines ofcode, has a large attack surface. If a function is not really needed,leave itout.2.Principle of fail-safe defaults.Say you need to organize the accessto a resource. It is better to makeexplicit rules about when one canaccess the resource than trying to identify the condition under whichaccess to the resource should be denied. Phrased differently: a defaultof lack of permission is safer.3.Principle of complete mediation.Every access to every resourceshould be checked for authority.Itimplies that we must have a way todetermine the source of a request (the requester).4.Principle of least authority.This principle, often known asPOLA,states that any(sub) system should have just enough authority (privi-lege) to perform its task and no more. Thus, if attackers compromisesuch a system, theyelevate their privilege by only the bare minimum.5.Principle of privilege separation.Closely related to the previouspoint: it is better to split up the system into multiple POLA-compliantcomponents than a single component with all the privileges combin-ed. Again, if one component is compromised, the attackers will belimited in what theycan do.6.Principle of least common mechanism.This principle is a littletrickier and states that we should minimize the amount of mechanismcommon to more than one user and depended on by all users. Thinkof it this way: if we have a choice between implementing a networkroutine in the operating system where its global variables are sharedby all users, or in a user space library which, to all intents and pur-poses, is private to the user process, we should opt for the latter.Theshared data in the operating system may well serveasaninformationpath between different users.

In1883, the Dutch-born AugusteKerckhoffs published twojournal articles on military cryptographywhich stated that a cryptosystem should be secure evenifeverythingabout the system, except the key,ispublic knowledge. In other words,do not rely on ‘‘security by obscurity,’’but assume that the adversaryimmediately gains familiarity with your system and knows the en-cryption and decryption algorithms.8.Principle of psychological acceptability.The final principle is not atechnical one at all. Security rules and mechanisms should be easy touse and understand. Again, manyimplementations of PGP protectionfor email fail this principle. However, acceptability entails more.Besides the usability of the mechanism, it should also be clear whythe rules and mechanisms are necessary in the first place.An important factor in ensuring security is also the concept ofisolation.Isola-tion guarantees the separation of components (programs, computer systems, orevenentire networks) that belong to different security domains or have differentprivileges. All interaction that takes place between the different components ismediated with proper privilege checks. Isolation, POLA, and a tight control of theflowofinformation between components allowthe design of strongly compart-mentalized systems.Network security comprises concerns in the domain of systems and engineer-ing as well as concerns rooted in theory,math, and cryptography. A good exampleof the former is the classicping of death,which allowed attackers to crash hostsall overthe Internet by using fragmentation options in IP to craft ICMP echo re-quest packets larger than the maximum allowed IP packet size. Since the receivingside neverexpected such large packets, it reserved insufficient buffer memory forall the data and the excess bytes would overwrite other data that followed the buff-er in memory.Clearly,this was a bug, commonly known as a buffer overflow. Anexample of a cryptographyproblem is the 40-bit key used in the original WEP en-cryption for WiFi networks which could be easily brute-forced by attackers withsufficient computational power.8.1.2 FundamentalAttack PrinciplesThe easiest way to structure a discussion about systems aspects of security is toput ourselves in the shoes of the adversary.So, having introducedfundamental as-pects of security above,let us nowconsider thefundamentals of attacks.From an attacker perspective,the security of a system presents itself as a set ofchallenges that attackers must solvetoreach their objectives. There are multipleways to violate confidentiality,integrity,availability,orany ofthe other security'),\n",

For instance, to break confidentiality of network traffic, an attacker maybreak into a system to read the data directly,trick the communicating parties tosend data without encryption and capture it, or,inamore ambitious scenario, breakthe encryption. All of these are used in practice and all of them consist of multiplesteps. Wewill deep dive into the fundamentals of attacks in Sec. 8.2. As a preview,let us consider the various steps and approaches attackers may use.1.Reconnaissance.Alexander Graham Bell once said: ‘‘Preparation isthe key tosuccess.’’ and thus it is for attackers also. The first thingyou do as an attacker is to get to knowasmuch about your target asyou can. In case you plan to attack by means of spam or social engin-eering, you may want to spend some time sifting through the onlineprofiles of the people you want to trick into giving up information, orevenengage in some old-fashioned dumpster diving. In this chapter,however, welimit ourselves to technical aspects of attacks anddefenses. Reconnaissance in network security is about discoveringinformation that helps the attacker.Which machines can we reachfrom the outside? Using which protocols? What is the topology of thenetwork? What services run on which machines? Et cetera. Wewilldiscuss reconnaissance in Sec. 8.2.12.Sniffing and Snooping.Animportant step in manynetwork attacksconcerns the interception of network packets. Certainly if sensitiveinformation is sent ‘‘in the clear’’(without encryption), the ability tointercept network trafficisvery useful for the attacker,but evenen-crypted trafficcan be useful—to find out the MACaddresses of com-municating parties, who talks to whom and when, etc. Moreover, anattacker needs to intercept the encrypted traffictobreak the en-cryption. Since an attacker has access to other people’snetwork traf-fic, the ability to sniffindicates that at least the principles of least au-thority and complete mediation are not sufficiently enforced. Sniffingis easy on a broadcast medium such as WiFi, but howtointercepttrafficifitdoes not eventraveloverthe link to which your computeris connected?Sniffing is the topic of Sec. 8.2.2.3.Spoofing.Another basic weapon in the hands of attackers is mas-querading as someone else. Spoofed network trafficpretends to origi-nate from some other machine. For instance, we can easily transmitan Ethernet frame or IP packet with a different source address, as ameans to bypass a defense or launch denial-of-service attacks, be-cause these protocols are very simple. However, can we also do so forcomplicated protocols such as TCP? After all, if you send a TCPSYN segment to set up a connection to a server with a spoofed IP ad-dress, the server will reply with its SYN/ACk segment (the secondphase of the connection setup) to that IP address, so unless the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 761}, page_content='738 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP.8attackers are on the same network segment, theywill not see the re-ply.Without that reply,theywill not knowthe sequence number usedby the server,and hence, theywill not be able to communicate.Spoofing circumvents the principle of complete mediation: if we can-not determine who sent a request, we cannot properly mediate it. InSec. 8.2.3, we discuss spoofing in detail.4.Disruption.The third component of our CIA triad, availability,hasgrown in importance also for attackers, with devastatingDoS(Denialof Service)attacks onall sorts of organizations. Moreover, inre-sponse to newdefenses, these attacks have grown evermore sophisti-cated. Onecan argue that DoS attacks abuse the fact that the prin-ciple of least common mechanism is not rigorously enforced—thereis insufficient isolation. In Sec. 8.2.4, we will look at the evolution ofsuch attacks.Using these fundamental building blocks, attackers can craft a wide range ofattacks. For instance, using reconnaissance and sniffing, attackers may find the ad-dress of a potential victim computer and discoverthat it trusts a server so that anyrequest coming from that server is automatically accepted. By means of adenial-of-service (disruption) attack theycan bring down the real server to makesure it does not respond to the victim anymore and then send spoofed requests thatappear to originate from the server.Infact, this is exactly howone of the mostfamous attacks in the history of the Internet (on the San Diego SupercomputerCenter) happened. Wewill discuss the attack later.8.1.3 From Threats to SolutionsAfter discussing the attacker’smoves, we will consider what we can do aboutthem. Since most attacks arrive overthe network, the security community quicklyrealized that the network may also be a good place to monitor for attacks. In Sec.8.3, we will look at firewalls, intrusion detection systems and similar defenses.Where Secs. 8.2 and 8.3 address the systems-related issues of attackers gettingtheir grubby little hands on sensitive information or systems, we devote Secs.8.4–8.9 to the more formal aspects of network security,when we discusscryptog-raphyandauthentication.Rooted in mathematics and implemented in computersystems, a variety of cryptographic primitiveshelp ensure that evenifnetwork traf-ficfalls in the wrong hands, nothing too bad can happen. For instance, attackerswill still not be able to break confidentiality,tamper with the content, or suc-cessfully replay a network conversation. There is a lot to say about cryptography,as there are different types of primitivesfor different purposes (proving authentic-ity,encryption using public keys, encryption using symmetric keys, etc.) and eachtype tends to have different implementations. In Sec. 8.4, we introduce the keyconcepts of cryptography, and Sections 8.5 and 8.6 discuss symmetric and public'),\n",

As we shall see, theytend to build oncryptography.In the sections following authentication, we survey concrete examples of (oftencrypto-based) network security solutions. In Sec.8.10, we discuss network tech-nologies that provide communication security,such as IPsec, VPNs, and Wirelesssecurity.Section 8.11looks at the problem of email security,including explana-tions of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)and S/MIME (Secure Multipurpose InternetMail Extension).Section 8.12discusses security in the wider Web domain, withdescriptions of secure DNS (DNSSEC), scripting code that runs in browsers, andthe Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).As we shall see, these technologies use manyofthe ideas discussed in the preceding sections.Finally,wediscuss social issues in Sec. 8.13. What are the implications for im-portant rights, such as privacy and freedom of speech? What about copyright andprotection of intellectual property?Security is an important topic so looking at itclosely is worthwhile.Before diving in, we should reiterate that security is an entire field of study inits own right. In this chapter,wefocus only on networks and communication, rath-er than issues related to hardware, operating systems, applications, or users. Thismeans that we will not spend much time looking at bugs and there is nothing hereabout user authentication using biometrics, password security,buffer overflowat-tacks, Trojan horses, login spoofing, process isolation, or viruses.All of these top-ics are covered at length in Chap. 9 ofModern Operating Systems(Tanenbaum andBos, 2015).The interested reader is referred to that book for the systems aspectsof security.Now let us begin our journey.8.2 THECORE INGREDIENTS OF AN ATTACKAs a first step, let us consider the fundamental ingredients that makeupanat-tack. Virtually all network attacks followarecipe that mixes some variants of theseingredients in a clevermanner.8.2.1 ReconnaissanceSay you are an attacker and one fine morning you decide that you will hack or-ganization X, where do you start?

You can always usesocialengineering,totry and extract sensitive information from employees by sendingthem emails (spam), or phoning them, or befriending them on social networks, butin this book, we are interested in more technical issues, related to computer net-works. For instance, can you find out what computers exist in the organization,howtheyare connected, and what services theyrun?As a starting point, we assume that an attacker has a fewIPaddresses of ma-chines in the organization: Web servers, name servers, login servers, or anyothermachines that communicate with the outside world. The first thing the attacker willwant to do is explore that server.Which TCP and UDP ports are open? An easywaytofind out is simply to try and set up a TCP connection to each and every portnumber.Ifthe connection is successful, there was a service listening. For instance,if the server replies on port 25, it suggests an SMTP server is present, if the con-nection succeeds on port 80, there will likely be a Web server,etc. Wecan use asimilar technique for UDP (e.g., if the target replies on UDP port 53, we knowitruns a domain name service because that is the port reserved for DNS).Port ScanningProbing a machine to see which ports are active isknown asport scanningand may get fairly sophisticated. The technique we described earlier,where an at-tacker sets up a full TCP connection to the target (aso-calledconnect scan)isnotsophisticated at all. While effective,its major drawback is that it is very visible tothe target’ssecurity team.Manyservers tend to log successful TCP connections,and showing up in logs during thereconnaissancephase is not what an attackerwants. Toavoid this, she can makethe connections deliberately unsuccessful bymeans of ahalf-open scan.Ahalf-open scan only pretends to set up connections:it sendsTCP packets with the SYN flag set to all port numbers of interest andwaits for the server to send the corresponding SYN/ACKs for the ports that areopen, but it nevercompletes the three-way handshake. Most servers will not logthese unsuccessful connection attempts.If half-open scans are better than connect scans, whydowestill discuss the lat-ter? The reason is that half-open scans require more advanced attackers. A fullconnection to a TCP port is typically possible from most machines using simpletools such as telnet, that are often available to unprivileged users. For a half-openscan, however, attackers need to determine exactly which packets should andshould not be transmitted. Most systems do not have standard tools for nonprivi-leged users to do this and only users withadministrator privileges can perform ahalf-open scan.Connect scans (sometimes referred to asopen scans)and half-open scans bothassume that it is possible to initiate a TCP connection from an arbitrary machineoutside the victim’snetwork. However, perhaps the firewall does not allowcon-nections to be set up from the attacker’smachine. For instance, it may block all'),\n",

In that case, the attacker may have toresort to more esoteric scan-ning techniques. For instance, rather than a SYN segment, aFIN scanwill send aTCP FIN segment, which is normally used to close a connection.At first sight,this does not makesense because there is no connection to terminate. However, theresponse to the FIN packet is often different for open ports (with listening servicesbehind them) and closed ports. In particular,manyTCP implementations send aTCP RST packet if the port is closed, and nothing at all if it is open.Fig. 8-2illus-trates these three basic scanning techniques.\\nPort 80 Port 80Server ServerServer\\nSYN\\n(a) Connect scan: connectionestablished implies port is open\\nSYN\\nACK\\nSYN/ACK Port 80FIN\\nRSTSYN/ACK\\n(b) Half open scan: SYN/ACKreply implies port open (c) FIN scan: RST reply impliesport is closedFigure8-2.Basic port scanning techniques.(a) Connect scan. (b) Half-openscan. (c) FIN scan.By this time, you are probably thinking: ‘‘If we can do this with the SYN flagsand the FIN flags, can we try some of the other flags?’’You would be right. Anyconfiguration that leads to different responses for open and closed ports works. Awell-known other option is to set manyflags at once (FIN, PSH, URG), somethingknown asXmas scan(because your packet is lit up likeaChristmas tree).Consider Fig.8-2(a). Ifaconnection can be established, it means the port isopen. Nowlook at Fig.8-2(b). ASYN/ACK reply implies the port is open.Final-ly,wehaveFig. 8-2(c).An RST reply means the port is open.Probing for open ports is a first step. The next thing the attacker wants to knowis exactly what server runs on this port, what software, what version of the soft-ware, and on what operating system. For instance, suppose we find that port 8080is open. This is probably a Web server,although this is not certain. Even if it is aWebserver,which one is it: Nginx, Lighttpd, Apache? Suppose an attacker onlyhas an exploit for Apache version 2.4.37 and only on Windows, finding out allthese details, known asfingerprintingis important. Just likeinour port scans, wedo so by making use of (sometimes subtle) differences in the way these servers andoperating systems reply.Ifall of this sounds complicated, do not worry.Likemanycomplicated things in computer networks, some helpful soul has sat down and'),\n",

Givenknowledge of that first IP ad-dress, attackers may try to ‘‘pokearound’’tosee what else is available. For in-stance, if the first machine has IP address 130.37.193.191, theymight also try130.37.193.192, 130.37.193.193, and all other possible addresses on the local net-work. Moreover, theycan use programs such astracerouteto find the path towardthe original IP address. Traceroute first sends a small batch of UDP packets to thetarget with the time-to-live (TTL) value set to one, then another batch with theTTL set to two, then a batch with a TTL of three, and so on. The first router lowersthe TTL and immediately drops the first packets (because the TTL has nowreached zero), and sends back an ICMP error message indicating that the packetshave outlivedtheir allocated life span. The second router does the same for the sec-ond batch of packets, the third for the third batch, until eventually some UDP pack-ets reach the target. By collecting the ICMP error packets andtheir source IP ad-dresses, traceroute is able to stitch together the overall route. Attackers can use theresults to scan evenmore targets by probing address ranges of routers close to thetarget, thusobtaining a rudimentary knowledge of the network topology.8.2.2 Sniffing and Snooping (with a Dash of Spoofing)Manynetwork attacks start with the interception of network traffic. For this at-tack ingredient, we assume that the attacker has a presence in the victim’snetwork.Forinstance, the attacker brings a laptop in range of the victim’sWiFi network, orobtains access to a PC in the wired network. Sniffing on a broadcast medium, suchas WiFi or the original Ethernet implementation is easy: you just tune into thechannel at a convenient location, and listen for the bits come thundering by.Todoso, attackers set their network interfaces inpromiscuous mode,tomakeitacceptall packets on the channel, eventhose destined for another host, and use tools suchastcpdumporWiresharkto capture the traffic.Sniffing in Switched NetworksHowever, inmanynetworks, things are not so easy.Takemodern Ethernet asan example. Unlikeits original incarnations, Ethernet today is no longer a propershared-medium network technology.All communication is switched and attackers,eveniftheyare connected to the same network segment, will neverreceive any ofthe Ethernet frames destined for the other hosts on the segment. Specifically,recall'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 766}, page_content='SEC. 8.2 THE CORE INGREDIENTS OF AN ATTACK 743that Ethernet switches are self-learning and quickly build up a forwarding table.The self-learning is simple and effective:assoon as an Ethernet frame from hostAarrivesatport 1, the switch records that trafficfor hostAshould be sent on port 1.Nowitknows that all trafficwith hostA’s MAC address in the destination field ofthe Ethernet header should be forwarded on port 1. Likewise, it will send the trafficfor hostBon port 2, and so on. Once the forwarding table is complete, the switchwill no longer send anytrafficexplicitly addressed to hostBon anyport other than2. Tosnifftraffic, attackers must find a way to makeexactly that happen.There are several ways for an attacker to overcome the switching problem.Theyall usespoofing.Nevertheless, we will discuss them in this section, since thesole goal here is to snifftraffic.The first isMACcloning,duplicating the MACaddress of the host of whichyou want to sniffthe traffic. If you claim to have this MACaddress (by sending outEthernet frames with that address), the switch will duly record this in its table andhenceforth send all trafficbound for the victim to your machine instead. Of course,this assumes that you knowthis address, but you should be able to obtain it fromthe ARP requests sent by the target that are, after all, broadcast to all hosts in thenetwork segment. Another complicating factor is that your mapping will be re-movedfrom the switch as soon as the original owner of the MACaddress startscommunicating again, so you will have torepeat thisswitch table poisoningcon-stantly.As an alternative,but in the same vein, attackers can use the fact that theswitch table has a limited size and flood the switch with Ethernet frames with fakesource addresses. The switch does not knowthe MACaddresses are fakeand sim-ply records them until the table is full, evicting older entries to include the newones if need be. Since the switch nownolonger has an entry for the target host, itreverts tobroadcast for all traffictowards it.MACfloodingmakes your Ethernetbehave likeabroadcast medium again and party likeitis1979.Instead of confusing the switch, attackers can also target hosts directly in aso-calledARP spoofingorARP poisoningattack. Recall from Chap.5that theARP protocol helps a computer find the MACaddress corresponding to an IP ad-dress. For this purpose, the ARP implementation on a machine maintains a tablewith mappings from IP to MACaddresses for all hosts that have communicatedwith this machine (theARP table). Eachentry has a time-to-live (TTL) of, typi-cally,afew tens of minutes. After that, the MACaddress of the remote party issilently forgotten, assuming there is no further communication between these par-ties (in which case the TTL is reset), and all subsequent communication requiresan ARP lookup first. The ARP lookup is simply a broadcast message that sayssomething like: ‘‘Folks, I am looking for the MACaddress of the host with IP ad-dress 192.168.2.24. If this is you, please let me know.’’ The lookup request con-tains the requester’sMAC address, so host 192.168.2.24 knows where to send thereply,and also the requester’sIPaddress, so 192.168.2.24 can add the IP to MACaddress of the requester to its own ARP table.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 767}, page_content='744 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP.8Wheneverthe attacker sees such an ARP request for host 192.168.2.24, shecan race to supply the requester with her own MACaddress. In that case, all com-munication for 192.168.2.24 will be sent to the attacker’smachine. In fact, sinceARP implementations tend to be simple and stateless, the attacker can often justsend ARP replies evenifthere was no request at all: the ARP implementation willaccept the replies at face value and store the mappings in its ARP table.By using this same trick on both communicating parties, the attacker receivesall the trafficbetween them. By subsequently forwarding the frames to the rightMACaddresses again, the attacker has installed a stealthyMITM(Man-in-the-Middle)gateway, capable of intercepting all trafficbetween the twohosts.8.2.3 Spoofing (beyond ARP)In general, spoofing means sending bytes overthe network with a falsifiedsource address. Besides ARP packets, attackers may spoof anyother type of net-work traffic. For instance, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a friendly,text-based protocol that is used everywhere for sending email. It uses theMail From:header as an indication of the source of an email, but by default it does not checkthis for correctness of the email address. In other words, you can put anything youwant in this header.All replies will be sent to this address. Incidentally,the contentof theMail From:header is not evenshown to the recipient of the email message. In-stead, your mail client shows the content of a separateFrom:header.However, thereis no check on this field either,and SMTP allows you to falsify it, so that the emailthat you send to your fellowstudents informing them that theyfailed the course ap-pears to have been sent by the course instructor.Ifyou additionally set theMail From:header to your own email address, all replies sent by panicking studentswill end up in your mailbox. What fun you will have!Less innocently,criminalsfrequently spoof email to send phishing emails from seemingly trusted sources.That email from ‘‘your doctor’’telling you to click on the link belowtoget urgentinformation about your medical test may lead to a site that says everything is nor-mal, but fails to mention that it just downloaded a virus to your computer.The onefrom ‘‘your bank’’can be bad for your financial health.ARP spoofing occurs at the link layer,and SMTP spoofing at the applicationlayer,but spoofing may happen at anylayer in the protocol stack. Sometimes,spoofing is easy.For instance, anyone with the ability to craft custom packets cancreate fakeEthernet frames, IP datagrams, or UDP packets. You only need tochange the source address and that is it: these protocols do not have any way todetect the tampering. Other protocols are much more challenging. For instance, inTCP connections the endpoints maintain state, such as the sequence and acknowl-edgement numbers, that makespoofing much trickier.Unless the attacker can sniffor guess the appropriate sequence numbers, the spoofed TCP segments will be re-jected by the receiveras‘‘out-of-window.’’ Asweshall see later,there are substan-tial other difficulties as well.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 768}, page_content='SEC. 8.2 THE CORE INGREDIENTS OF AN ATTACK 745Even the simple protocols allowattackers to cause a lot of damage. Shortly,wewill see howspoofed UDP packets may lead to devastatingDoSdenial-of-Serviceattacks. First, however, weconsider howspoofing permits attackers to interceptwhat clients send to a server by spoofing UDP datagrams in DNS.DNS SpoofingSince DNS uses UDP for its requests and replies, spoofing should be easy.Forinstance, just likeinthe ARP spoofing attack, we could wait for a client to send alookup request for domaintrusted-services.comand then race with the legitimatedomain name system to provide a false reply that informs the client thattrust-ed-services.comis located at an IP address owned by us. Doing so is easy if we cansniffthe trafficcoming from the client (and, thus, see the DNS lookup request towhich to respond), but what if we cannot see the request? After all, if we can al-ready sniffthe communication, intercepting it via DNS spoofing is not that useful.Also, what if we want to intercept the trafficofmanypeople instead of just one?The simplest solution, if attackers share the local name server of the victim, isthat theysend their own request for,say,trusted-services.com,which in turn willtrigger the local name server to do a lookup for this IP address on their behalf bycontacting the next name server in the lookup process. The attackers immediately‘‘reply’’tothis request by the local name server with a spoofed reply that appearsto come from the next name server.The result is that the local name server storesthe falsified mapping in its cache and serves it to the victim when it finally does thelookup fortrusted-services.com(and anyone else who may be looking up the samename). Note that evenifthe attackers do not share the local name, the attack maystill work, if the attacker can trick the victim into doing a lookup request with theattacker-provided domain name. For instance, the attacker could send anemailthat urges the victim to click on a link, so that the browser will do the name lookupfor the attacker.After poisoning the mapping fortrusted-services.com,all subse-quent lookups for this domain will return the false mapping.The astute reader will object that this is not so easy at all. After all, each DNSrequest carries a 16-bit query ID and a reply is accepted only if the ID in the replymatches. But if the attackers cannot see the request, theyhaveto guess the identi-fier.For a single reply,the odds of getting it right is one in 65,536. On average, anattacker would have tosend tens of thousands of DNS replies in a very short time,to falsify a single mapping at the local name server,and do so without beingnoticed. Not easy.Birthday AttackThere is an easier way that is sometimes referred to as a birthday attack (orbirthday paradox,eventhough strictly speaking it is not a paradox at all).Theidea for this attack comes from a technique that math professors often use in their'),\n",

Anyway,immediatelyafter sending the requests, the attackers also sendhundreds of spoofed ‘‘replies’’for the lookup, each pretending to come from the next-levelname server and carry-ing a different guess for the query ID. The local name server implicitly performsthe many-to-manycomparison for us because if anyreply ID matches that of a re-quest sent by the local name server,the reply will be accepted. Note howthis scen-ario resembles that of the students’ birthdays: the name server compares all re-quests sent by the local name server with all spoofed replies.By poisoning the local name server for a particular Web site, say,the attackersobtain access to the trafficsent to this site for all clients of the name server.Byset-ting up their own connections to the Web site and then relaying all communicationfrom the clients and all communication from the server,theynow serveasastealthyman-in-the-middle.KaminskyAttackThings may get evenworse when attackers poison the mapping not just for asingle Web site, but for an entire zone. The attack is known as Dan Kaminsky’sDNS attack and it caused a huge panic among information security officers andnetwork administrators the world over.

The reply,shown in Fig.8-4 has a fewinteresting fields to discuss. First, we observe, without going into details, that theflags indicate explicitly that the server does not want to do recursive lookups, sothe remainder of the lookup will be iterative.Second, the query ID of the reply isalso 1337, matching that of the lookup. Third, the reply provides the symbolicnames of the name servers of the universityns1.vu.nlandns2.vu.nlas NS records.These answers are authoritative and, in principle, suffice for the local name serverto complete the query: by first performing a lookup for the A record of one of thename servers and subsequently contacting it, it can ask for the IP address ofwww.cs.vu.nl.However, doing so means that it will first contact the same TLDname server again, this time to ask for the IP address of the university’sname ser-ver, and as this incurs an extra round trip time, it is not very efficient. Toavoid thisextra lookup, the TLD name server helpfully provides the IP addresses of the twouniversity name servers as additional records in its reply,each with a short TTL.These additional records are known asDNS glue recordsand are the key totheKaminskyattack.Here is what the attackers will do.

Clearly,the Internet had a problem. An emergencymeeting washastily organized in Microsoft’sheadquarters in Redmond. Kaminskylater statedthat all of this was shrouded in such secrecythat ‘‘there were people on jets toMicrosoft who didn’tevenknowwhat the bug was.’’So howdid these cleverpeople solvethe problem? The answer is, theydidn’t,not really.What theydid do is makeitharder.Recall that a core problem of theseDNS spoofing attacks is that the query ID is only 16 bits, making it possible toguess it, either directly or by means of a birthday attack. A larger query ID makesthe attack much less likely to succeed. However, simply changing the format of theDNS protocol message is not so easy and would also break manyexisting systems.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 772}, page_content='SEC. 8.2 THE CORE INGREDIENTS OF AN ATTACK 749The solution was to extend the length of the random ID without really extendingthe query ID, by instead introducing randomness also in the UDP source port.When sending out a DNS request to, say,the TLD name server,apatched nameserver would pick a random port out of thousands of possible port numbers and usethat as the UDP source port. Nowthe attacker must guess not just the query ID, butalso the port number and do so before the legitimate reply arrives. The 0x20 encod-ing that we described in Chap. 7 exploits the case-insensitive nature of DNSqueries to add evenmore bits to the transaction ID.Fortunately,DNSSEC,provides a more solid defense against DNS spoofing.DNSSEC consists of a collection of extensions to DNS that offer both integrity andorigin authentication of DNS data to DNS clients.However, DNSSEC deploymenthas been extremely slow. The initial work on DNSSEC was conducted in the early1990s and the first RFC was published by the IETF in 1997; DNSSEC is nowstart-ing to see more widespread deployment, as we will discuss later in this chapter.TCP SpoofingCompared to the protocols discussed so far,spoofing in TCP is infinitely morecomplicated. When attackers want to pretend that a TCP segment came from an-other computer on the Internet, theynot only have toguess the port number,butalso the correct sequence numbers. Moreover, keeping a TCP connection in goodshape, while injecting spoofed TCP segments is very complicated.We distinguishbetween twocases:1.Connection spoofing.The attacker sets up anewconnection, pre-tending to be someone at a different computer.2.Connection hijacking.The attacker injects data in a connection thatalready exists between twoparties, pretending to be either of thesetwoparties.The best-known example ofTCP connection spoofingwasthe attack byKevin Mitnickagainst the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC) on Christ-mas day 1994. It is one of the most famous hacks in history,and the subject of sev-eral books and movies. Incidentally,one of them is a fairly big-budget flick called‘‘Takedown,’’ that is based on a book that was written by the system administratorof the Supercomputing Center.(Perhaps not surprisingly,the administrator in themovie is portrayed as a very cool guy). Wediscuss it here because it illustrates thedifficulties in TCP spoofing quite well.Kevin Mitnick had a long history of being an Internet bad boybefore he set hissights on SDSC. Incidentally,attacking on Christmas day is generally a good ideabecause on public holidays there are fewer users and administrators around. Aftersome initial reconnaissance, Mitnick discovered that an (X-terminal) computer inSDSC had a trust relationship with another (server) machine in the same center.'),\n",

Specifically,the server was implicitly trustedand anyone on the server could log in on the X-terminal as administrator using re-mote shell (rsh)without the need to enter a password. His plan was to set up a TCPconnection to the X-terminal, pretending to be the server and use it to turn offpass-word protection altogether—in those days, this could be done by writing ‘‘++’’ inthe.rhostsfile.Doing so, however, was not easy.IfMitnick had sent a spoofed TCP con-nection setup request (a SYN segment) to the X-terminal with the IP address of theserver (step 1 in Fig.8-5(b)), the X-terminal would have sent its SYN/ACK replyto the actual server,and this reply would have been invisible to Mitnick (step 2 inFig. 8-5(b)).As a result, he would not knowthe X-terminal’sinitial sequencenumber (ISN), a more-or-less random number that he would need for the thirdphase of the TCP handshake(which as we sawearlier,isthe first segment that maycontain data). What is worse, upon reception of the SYN/ACK, the server wouldhave immediately responded with an RST segment to terminate the connection set-up (step 3 in Fig.8-5(c)). Afterall, there must have been a problem, as it neversent a SYN segment.\\n(a) (b) (c)\\nTrustedserver(Server can loginwithout password)X-terminal\\nMitnick\\nTrustedserverX-terminalNot visible to Mitnick2.

For instance, if it would start at 0 for every newconnection. However,since the ISN was chosen more or less random for every connection, Mitnick need-ed to find out howitwas generated in order topredictthe number that the X-termi-nal would use in its invisible SYN/ACK to the server.To overcome these challenges, Mitnick launched his attack in several steps.First, he interacted extensively with the X-terminal using nonspoofed SYN mes-sages (step 1 in Fig.8-6(a)). Whilethese TCP connection attempts did not get himaccess to the machine, theydid give him a sequence of ISNs. Fortunately forKevin, the ISNs were notthatrandom. He stared at the numbers for a while untilhe found a pattern and was confident that givenone ISN, he would be able to pre-dict the next one. Next, he made sure that the trusted server would not be able toreset his connection attempts by launching a DoS attack that made the server unre-sponsive (step 2 in Fig.8-6(b)).

As a result, the Mitnick attack is no longer practical. Modernattackers need to find a different way to guess the initial sequence numbers, forinstance, the one employed in the connection hijacking attack we describe noTCP Connection HijackingCompared to connection spoofing, connection hijacking adds evenmore hur-dles to overcome. For now, let us assume that the attackers are able to eavesdrop onan existing connection between twocommunicating parties (because theyare onthe same network segment) and therefore knowthe exact sequence numbers and allother relevant information related to this communication. In a hijacking attack, theaim is to takeoveranexisting connection, by injecting data into the stream.To makethis concrete, let us assume that the attacker wants to inject some datainto the TCP connection that exists between a client who is logged in to a Web ap-plication at a server with the aim of making either the client or server receive at-tacker-injected bytes. In our example, the sequence numbers of the last bytes sentby the client and server are 1000 and 12,500, respectively.Assume that all data re-ceivedsofar have been acknowledged and the client and server are not currentlysending anydata. Nowthe attacker injects, say,100 bytes into the TCP stream tothe server,bysending a spoofed packet with the client’sIPaddress and source port,as well as the server’sIPaddress and source port. This 4-tuple is enough to makethe network stack demultiplexthe data to the right socket. In addition, the attackerprovides the appropriate sequence number (1001) and acknowledgement number(12501), so TCP will pass the 100-byte payload to the Web server.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 775}, page_content='752 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP.8However, there is a problem. After passing the injected bytes to the applica-tion, the server will acknowledge them to the client: ‘‘Thank you for the bytes, Iam nowready to receive byte number 1101.’’ This message comes as a surprise tothe client, who thinks the server is confused. After all, it neversent anydata, andstill intends to send byte 1001. It promptly tells the server so, by sending an emptysegment with sequence number 1001 and acknowledgement number 12501.‘‘Wow’’ says the server,‘‘thanks, but this looks likeanold ACK. By now, I alreadyreceivedthe next 100 bytes. Best tell the remote party about this.’’ Itresends theACK(seq = 1101, ack = 12501), which leads to another ACK by the client, and soon. This phenomenon is known as anACKstorm.Itwill neverstop until one ofthe ACKs gets lost (because TCP does not retransmit dataless ACKs).Howdoes the attacker quell the ACK storm? There are several tricks and wewill discuss all of them. The simplest one is to tear down the connection explicitlyby sending an RST segment to the communicating parties. Alternatively,the at-tacker may be able to use ARP poisoning to cause one of the ACKs to be sent to anonexisting address, forcing it to get lost. An alternative strategy is to desynchro-nize the twosides of the connection so much that all data sent by the client will beignored by the server and vice versa. Doing so by sending lots of data is quite in-volved, but an attacker can easily accomplish this at the connection setup phase.The idea is as follows. The attacker waits until the client sets up a connection to theserver.Assoon as the server replies with a SYN/ACK, the attacker sends it an RSTpacket to terminate the connection, immediately followed by a SYN packet, withthe same IP address and TCP source port as the ones originally used by the client,butadifferent client-side sequence number.After the subsequent SYN/ACK by theserver,the server and client are both in the established state, but theycannot com-municate with each other,because their sequence numbers are so far apart that theyare always out-of-window. Instead, the attacker plays the role of man-in-the-middleand relays data between the twoparties, able to inject data at will.Off-Path TCP ExploitsSome of the attacks are very complexand hard to evenunderstand, let alonedefend against. Inthis section we will look at one of the more complicated ones.In most cases, attackers are not on the same network segment and cannot sniffthetrafficbetween the parties. Attacks in such a scenario are known as off-path TCPexploits and are very trickytopull off. Even if we ignore the ACK storm, the at-tacker needs a lot of information to inject data into an existing connection:1. Even before the actual attack, the attackers should discoverthat thereis a connection between twoparties on the Internet to begin with.2. Thentheyshould determine the port numbers to use.3. Finally,theyneed the sequence numbers.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 776}, page_content='SEC. 8.2 THE CORE INGREDIENTS OF AN ATTACK 753Quite a tall order,ifyou are on the other side of the Internet, but not necessar-ily impossible, though. Decades after the Mitnick attack on SDSC, security re-searchers discovered a newvulnerability that permitted them to perform an off-path TCP exploit on widely deployed Linux systems. Theydescribed their attack inapaper titled ‘‘Off-Path TCP Exploits: Global Rate Limit Considered Dangerous,’’which is a very apt title, as we shall see. Wediscuss it here because it illustratesthat secret information can sometimes leak in an indirect way.Ironically,the attack was made possible by a novelfeature that was supposedto makethe system more secure, not less secure. Recall that we said off-path datainjections were very difficult because the attacker had to guess the port numbersand the sequence numbers and getting this right in a brute force attack is unlikely.Still, you just might get it right. Especially since you do not evenhaveto get thesequence number exactly right, as long as the data you send is ‘‘in-window.’’ Thismeans that with some (small) probability,attackers may reset, or inject data intoexisting connections. In August 2010, a newTCP extension appeared in the formof RFC 5961 to remedy this problem.RFC 5961 changed howTCP handled the reception of SYN segments, RSTsegments, and regular data segments. Thereason that the vulnerability existedonly in Linux is that only Linux implemented the RFC correctly.Toexplain what itdid, we should consider first howTCP worked before the extension. Let us consid-er the reception of SYN segments first. Before RFC 5961, wheneverTCP receivedaSYN segment for an already existing connection, it would discard the packet if itwasout-of-window, but it would reset the connection if it was in-window. The rea-son is that upon receiving a SYN segment, TCP would assume that the other sidehad restarted and thus that the existing connection was no longer valid. This is notgood, as an attacker only needs to get one SYN segment with a sequence numbersomewhere in the receiverwindowtoreset a connection.What RFC 5961 propos-ed instead was to not reset the connection immediately,but first send achallengeACKto the apparent sender of the SYN. If the packet did come from the legitimateremote peer,itmeans that it really did lose the previous connection and is nowset-ting up a newone. Upon receiving the challenge ACK, it will therefore send anRST packet with the correct sequence number.The attackers cannot do this sincetheyneverreceivedthe challenge ACK.The same story holds for RST segments. In traditional TCP,hosts would dropthe RST packets if theyare out-of-window, and reset the connection if theyarein-window. Tomakeitharder to reset someone else’sconnection, RFC 5961 pro-posed to reset the connection immediately only if the sequence number in the RSTsegment was exactly the one at the start of the receiverwindow(i.e., next expectedsequence number). If the sequence number is not an exact match, but still in-win-dow, the host does not drop the connection, but sends a challenge ACK. If thesender is legitimate, it will send a RST packet with the right sequence number.Finally,for data segments, old-style TCP conducts twochecks. First, it checksthe sequence number.Ifthat was in-window, italso checks the acknowledgement'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 777}, page_content='754 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP.8number.Itconsiders acknowledgement numbers valid as long as theyfall in an(enormous) interval. Let us denote the sequence numbers of the first unacknow-ledged byte byFUBand the sequence number of the next byte to be sent byNEXT.All packets with acknowledgement numbers in [FUB< 2GB,NEXT]arevalid, or half the ACK number space. This is easy to get right for an attacker!Moreover, ifthe acknowledgement number also happens to be in-window, itwouldprocess the data and advance the windowinthe usual way.Instead, RFC 5961 saysthat while we should accept packets with acknowledgement numbers that are(roughly) in-window, weshould send challenge ACKs for the ones that are in thewindow[FUB< 2GB,FUB< MAXWIN], where MAXWIN is the largest windoweveradvertised by the peer.The designers of the protocol extension quickly recognized that it may lead toahuge number of challenge ACKs, and proposed ACK throttling as a solution. Inthe implementation of Linux, this meant that it would send at most 100 challengeACKs per second, across all connections. In other words, a global variable sharedby all connections kept track of howmanychallenge ACKs were sent and if thecounter reached 100, it would send no more challenge ACKs for that one-secondinterval, whateverhappened.All this sounds good, but there is a problem. A single global variable repres-ents shared state that can serveasaside channel for cleverattacks. Let us takethefirst obstacle the attackers must overcome: are the twoparties communicating?Recall that a challenge ACK is sent in three scenarios:1. ASYN segment has the right source and destination IP addresses andport numbers,regardless of the sequence number.2. ARST segment where the sequence number is in-window.3. Adata segment where additionally the acknowledgement number isin the challenge window.Let us say that the attackers want to knowwhether a user at 130.37.20.7 is talkingto a Web server (destination port 80) at 37.60.194.64. Since the attackers need notget the sequence number right, theyonly need to guess the source port number.Todo so, theyset up their own connection to the Web server and send 100 RST pack-ets in quick succession, in response to which the server sends 100 challenge ACKs,unless it has already sent some challenge ACKs, in which case it would send fewer.However, this is quite unlikely.Inaddition to the 100 RSTs, the attackers thereforesend a spoofed SYN segment, pretending to be the client at 130.37.20.7, with aguessed port number.Ifthe guess is wrong, nothing happens and the attackers willstill receive the 100 challenge ACKs. However, iftheyguessed the port numbercorrectly,weend up in scenario (1), where the server sends a challenge ACK to thelegitimate client. But since the server can only send 100 challenge ACKs per sec-ond, this means that the attackers receive only 99. In other words, by counting thenumber of challenge ACKs, the attackers can determine not just that the twohosts'),\n",

Ofcourse, you need quite a fewtries to get it right, but this is definitely doable. Also,there are various techniques to makethis more efficient.Once the attackers have the port number theycan move tothe next phase of theattack: guessing the sequence and acknowledgement numbers. The idea is quitesimilar.For the sequence number the attackers again send 100 legitimate RSTpackets (spurring the server into sending challenge ACKs) and an additional spoof-ed RST packet with the right IP addresses and nowknown port numbers,as wellas aguessed sequence number.Ifthe guess is in-window, weare in scenario 2.Thus, by counting the challenge ACKs the attackers receive,theycan determinewhether the guess was correct.Finally,for the acknowledgement number theysend, in addition to the 100RST packets, a data packet with all fields filled in correctly,but with a guess forthe acknowledgement number,and apply the same trick. Nowthe attackers have allthe information theyneed to reset the connection, or inject data.The off-path TCP attack is a good illustration of three things. First, it showshowcrazy complicated network attacks may get. Second, it is an excellent exampleof a network-basedside-channel attack.Such attacks leak important informationin an indirect way.Inthis case, the attackers learned all the connection details bycounting something that appears very unrelated. Third, the attack shows that globalshared state is the core problem of such side-channel attacks. Side-channel vulner-abilities appear everywhere, in both software and hardware, and in all cases, theroot cause is the sharing of some important resource. Of course, we knewthis al-ready,asitisaviolation of Saltzer and Schroeder’sgeneral principle of least com-mon mechanism which we discussed in the beginning of this chapter.From a se-curity perspective,itisgood to remember that often sharing is not caring!Before we move tothe next topic (disruption and denial of service), it is goodto knowthat data injection is not just nice in theory,itisactively used in practice.After the revelations by Edward Snowden in 2013, it became clear that the NSA(National Security Agency) ran a mass surveillance operation.One of its activitieswasQuantum, a sophisticated network attack that used packet injection to redirecttargeted users connecting to popular services (such asTwitter,Gmail,orFacebook)to special servers that would then hack the victims’ computers to give the NSAcomplete control.

An example of such an attack was the ping of death we dis-cussed earlier.2.Algorithmic complexity.The attacker sends data that is crafted spe-cifically to create a lot of (algorithmic) overhead. Suppose a server al-lows clients to send rich search queries. In that case, an algorithmiccomplexity attack may consist of a number of complicated regularexpressions that incur the worst-case search time for the server.3.Flooding/swamping.The attacker bombards the victim with such amassive flood of requests or replies that the poor system cannot keepup. Often, but not always, the victim eventually crashes.Flooding attacks have become a major headache for organizations becausethese days it is very easy and cheap to carry out large-scale DoS attacks. For a fewdollars or euros, you can rent a botnet consisting of manythousands of machines toattack anyaddress you like. Ifthe attack data is sent from a large number of dis-tributed machines, we refer to the attack as aDDoS,(Distributed Denial-of-Ser-vice)attack. Specializedservices on the Internet, known asbootersorstressers,offer user-friendly interfaces to help evennontechnical users to launch them.SYN FloodingIn the old days, DDoS attacks were quite simple. For instance, you would use alarge number of hacked machines to launch a SYN flooding attack. All of thesemachines would send TCP SYN segments to the server,often spoofed to makeitappear as if theycame from different machines. While the server responded with aSYN/ACK, nobody would complete the TCP handshake, leaving the server dan-gling. That is quite expensive.Ahost can only keep a limited number of con-nections in the half-open state. After that, it no longer accepts newconnections.There are manysolutions for SYN flooding attacks. For instance, we may sim-ply drop half-open connections when we reach a limit to give preference to newconnections or reduce the SYN-receivedtimeout. Anelegant and very simplesolution, supported by manysystems today goes by the name ofSYN cookies,alsobriefly discussed in Chap. 6.Systems protected with SYN cookies use a specialalgorithm to determine the initial sequence number in such a way that the serverdoes not need to rememberanythingabout a connection until it receivesthe thirdpacket in the three-way handshake. Recall that a sequence number is 32 bits wide.With SYN cookies, the server chooses the initial sequence number as follows:1. Thetop 5 bits are the value oftmodulo32, wheretis a slowly incre-menting timer (e.g., a timer that increases every 64 seconds).2. Thenext 3 bits are an encoding of the MSS (maximum segment size),giving eight possible values for the MSS.'),\n",

Theremaining 24 bits are the value of a cryptographic hash overthetimestamptand the source and destination IP addresses and portnumbers.The advantage of this sequence number is that the server can just stick it in aSYN/ACK and forget about it. If the handshakenevercompletes, it is no skin offits back (or offwhateveritisthe server has on its back). If the handshakedoescomplete, containing its own sequence number plus one in the acknowledgement,the server is able to reconstruct all the state it requires to establish the connection.First, it checks that the cryptographic hash matches a recent value oftand thenquickly rebuilds the SYN queue entry using the MSS encoded in the 3 bits. WhileSYN Cookies allowonly eight different segment sizes and makethe sequencenumber growfaster than usual, the impact is minimal in practice. What is particu-larly nice is that the scheme is compatible with normal TCP and does not requirethe client to support the same extension.Of course, it is still possible to launch a DDoS attack eveninthe presence ofSYN cookies by completing the handshake, but this is more expensive for the at-tackers (as their own machines have limits on open TCP connections also), andmore importantly,prevents TCP attacks with spoofed IP addresses.Reflection and Amplification in DDoS AttacksHowever, TCP-based DDoS attacks are not the only game in town. In recentyears, more and more of the large-scale DDoS attacks have used UDP as the tran-sport protocol. Spoofing UDP packets is typically easy.Moreover, with UDP it ispossible to trick legitimate servers on the Internet to launch so-calledreflectionattackson a victim. In a reflection attack, the attacker sends a request with aspoofed source address to a legitimate UDP service, for instance, a name server.The server will then reply to the spoofed address. If we do this from a large num-ber of servers, the deluge of UDP reply packets is more than likely to takedownthe victim. Reflection attacks have two main advantages.1. Byadding the extra levelofindirection, the attacker makes it difficultfor the victim to block the senders somewhere in the network (afterall, the senders are all legitimate servers).2. Manyservices canamplifythe attack by sending large replies to smallrequests.These amplification-based DDoS attacks have been responsible for some of thelargest volumes of DDoS attack trafficinhistory,easily reaching into theTerabit-per-second range. What the attacker must do for a successful amplificationattack is to look for publicly accessible services with a large amplification factor.Forinstance, where one small request packet becomes a large reply packet, or'),\n",

The byte amplification factor representsthe relative gain in bytes, while the packet amplification factor represents the rela-tive gain packets. Figure8-7 shows the amplification factors for several popularprotocols. While these numbers may look impressive,itisgood to remember thatthese are averages and individual servers may have evenhigher ones. Interestingly,DNSSEC, the protocol that was intended to fix the security problems of DNS, hasamuch higher amplification factor than plain old DNS, exceeding 100 for someservers. Not to be outdone,misconfiguredmemcachedservers (fast in-memorydatabases), clocked an amplification factor well exceeding 50,000 during a massiveamplification attack of 1.7 Tbps in 2018.Protocol Byteamplification Packet amplificationNTP 556.93.8DNS 54.6 2.1Bittorrent 3.8 1.6Figure8-7.Amplification factors for popular protocolsDefending against DDoS AttacksDefending against such enormous streams of trafficisnot easy,but severaldefenses exist. One, fairly straightforward technique is to block trafficclose to thesource. The most common way to do so is using a technique calledegress filter-ing,whereby a network device such as a firewall blocks all outgoing packetswhose source IP addresses do not correspond to those inside the network where itis attached. This, of course, requires the firewall to knowwhat packets could possi-bly arrive with a particular source IP address, which is typically only possible atthe edge of the network; for example, a university network might knowall IPaddress ranges on its campus network and could thus block outgoing trafficfromanyIPaddress that it did not own. The dual to egress filtering isingress filtering,whereby a network device filters all incoming trafficwith internal IP addresses.Another measure we can takeistotry and absorb the DDoS attack with sparecapacity.Doing so is expensive and may be unaffordable on an individual basis, forall but the biggest players. Fortunately,there is no reason to do this individually.By pooling resources that can be used by manyparties, evensmaller players canafford DDoS protection. Likeinsurance, the assumption is that not everybody willbe attacked at the same time.So what insurance will you get? Several organizations offer to protect yourWebsite by means ofcloud-based DDoS protectionwhich uses the strength ofthe cloud, to scale up capacity as and when needed, to fend offDoS attacks. At itscore, the defense consists of the cloud shielding and evenhiding the IP address ofthe real server.All requests are sent to proxies in the cloud that filter out the'),\n",

In other words, the cloud‘‘absorbs’’the flood of data. Typically,itmay also operate as ascrubberto sani-tize the data as well. For instance, it may remove overlapping TCP segments orweird combinations of TCP flags, and serveingeneral as aWAF(WebApplica-tion Firewall).To relay the trafficvia the cloud-based proxies Web site owners can choose be-tween several options with different price tags. If theycan afford it, theycan optforBGP blackholing.Inthis case, the assumption is that the Web site owner con-trols an entire /24 block of (16,777,216) addresses. The idea is that the owner sim-ply withdraws the BGP announcements for that block from its own routers. In-stead, the cloud-based security provider starts announcing this IP fromitsnetwork,so that all trafficfor the server will go to the cloud first. However, not everybodyhas entire network blocks to play around with, or can afford the cost of BGPrerouting. For them, there is the more economical option to useDNS rerouting.Inthis case, the Web site’sadministrators change the DNS mappings in their nameservers to point to servers in the cloud, rather than the real server.Ineither case,visitors will send their packets to the proxies owned by the cloud-based securityprovider first and these cloud-basedproxies subsequently forward the packets tothe real server.DNS rerouting is easier to implement, but the security guarantees of the cloud-based security provider are only strong if the real IP address of the server remainshidden. If the attackers obtain this address, theycan bypass the cloud and attackthe server directly.Unfortunately,there are manyways in which the IP addressmay leak. LikeFTP,some Web applications send the IP address to the remote partyin-band, so there is not a lot one could do in those cases. Alternatively,attackerscould look at historical DNS data to see what IP addresses were registered for theserver in the past. Several companies collect and sell such historical DNS data.8.3 FIREWALLS AND INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEMSThe ability to connect anycomputer,anywhere, to anyother computer,any-where, is a mixed blessing.Forindividuals at home, wandering around the Internetis lots of fun.Forcorporate security managers, it is a nightmare.Most companieshave large amounts of confidential information online—trade secrets, product de-velopment plans, marketing strategies, financial analyses, tax records, etc.Disclo-sure of this information to a competitor could have dire consequences.In addition to the danger of information leaking out, there is also a danger ofinformation leaking in.In particular,viruses, worms, and other digital pests canbreach security,destroyvaluable data, and waste large amounts of administrators’'),\n",

Onemethod is to use encryption, which protects data in transit betweensecure sites.However, itdoes nothing to keep digital pests and intruders from get-ting onto the company’sLAN. Tosee howtoaccomplish this goal, we need tolook at firewalls.8.3.1 FirewallsFirewalls are just a modern adaptation of that old medievalsecurity standby:digging a wide and deep moat around your castle.This design forced everyoneentering or leaving the castle to pass overasingle drawbridge, where theycould beinspected by the I/O police.With networks, the same trick is possible: a companycan have manyLANs connected in arbitrary ways, but all traffictoorfrom thecompanyisforced through an electronic drawbridge (firewall), as shown inFig. 8-8.No other route exists.Internal networkDeMilitarized zoneExternal\\nInternet\\nEmailserverWebserverSecurityperimeterFirewall\\nFigure8-8.Afirewall protecting an internal network.The firewall acts as apacket filter.Itinspects each and every incoming andoutgoing packet. Packets meeting some criterion described in rules formulated bythe network administrator are forwarded normally.Those that fail the test areunceremoniously dropped.The filtering criterion is typically givenasrules or tables that list sources anddestinations that are acceptable, sources and destinations that are blocked, and de-fault rules about what to do with packets coming from or going to other machines.In the common case of a TCP/IP setting, a source or destination might consist ofan IP address and a port.Ports indicate which service is desired.Forexample,TCP port 25 is for mail, and TCP port 80 is for HTTP.Some ports can simply beblocked outright.Forexample, a companycould block incoming packets for all IPaddresses combined with TCP port 79. It was once popular for the Finger service'),\n",

Thedifficulty is that network adminis-trators want security but cannot cut offcommunication with the outside world.That arrangement would be much simpler and better for security,but there wouldbe no end to user complaints about it.This is where arrangements such as theDMZ(DeMilitarized Zone)shown in Fig.8-8 come in handy.The DMZ is thepart of the companynetwork that lies outside of the security perimeter.Anythinggoes here. By placing a machine such as a Web server in the DMZ, computers onthe Internet can contact it to browse the companyWeb site. Nowthe firewall canbe configured to block incoming TCP traffictoport 80 so that computers on the In-ternet cannot use this port to attack computers on the internal network. Toallowthe Web server to be managed, the firewall can have a rule to permit connectionsbetween internal machines and the Web server.Firewalls have become much more sophisticated overtime in an arms racewith attackers. Originally,firewalls applied a rule set independently for each pack-et, but it proveddifficult to write rules that allowed useful functionality but blockedall unwanted traffic.Stateful firewallsmap packets to connections and useTCP/IP header fields to keep track of connections. This allows for rules that, forexample, allowanexternal Web server to send packets to an internal host, but onlyif the internal host first establishes a connection with the external Web server.Sucharule is not possible with stateless designs that must either pass or drop all packetsfrom the external Web server.Another levelofsophistication up from stateful processing is for the firewall toimplementapplication-levelgateways.This processing involves the firewalllooking inside packets, beyond eventhe TCP header,tosee what the application isdoing. With this capability,itispossible to distinguish HTTP trafficused for Webbrowsing from HTTP trafficused for peer-to-peer file sharing. Administrators canwrite rules to spare the companyfrom peer-to-peer file sharing but allowWebbrowsing that is vital for business. For all of these methods, outgoing trafficcan beinspected as well as incoming traffic, for example, to prevent sensitive documentsfrom being emailed outside of the company.As the above discussion should makeabundantly clear,firewalls violate thestandard layering of protocols.Theyare network layer devices, but theypeek atthe transport and applications layers to do their filtering. Thismakes them fragile.Forinstance, firewalls tend to rely on standard port numbering conventions to de-termine what kind of trafficiscarried in a packet. Standard ports are often used,butnot by all computers, and not by all applications either.Some peer-to-peer ap-plications select ports dynamically to avoid being easily spotted (and blocked).Moreover, encryption hides higher-layer information from the firewall. Finally,afirewall cannot readily talk to the computers that communicate through it to tellthem what policies are being applied and whytheir connection is being dropped. Itmust simply pretend that it is a broken wire.Forthese reasons, networking purists'),\n",

However, theInternet can be a dangerous place if you are a computer.Firewalls help with thatproblem, so theyare likely to stay.Even if the firewall is perfectly configured, plenty of security problems stillexist. For example, if a firewall is configured to allowinpackets from only specif-ic networks (e.g., the company’sother plants), an intruder outside the firewall canspoof the source addresses to bypass this check.If an insider wants to ship outsecret documents, he can encrypt them or evenphotograph them and ship the pho-tos as JPEG files, which bypasses anyemail filters. Andwe have not evendis-cussed the fact that, although three-quarters of all attacks come from outside thefirewall, the attacks that come from inside the firewall, for example, from disgrun-tled employees, may be the most damaging (Verizon, 2009).Adifferent problem with firewalls is that theyprovide a single perimeter ofdefense. If that defense is breached, all bets are off. For this reason, firewalls areoften used in a layered defense. For example, a firewall may guard the entrance tothe internal network and each computer may also run its own firewall, too.Reade-rs who think that one security checkpoint is enough clearly have not made an inter-national flight on a scheduled airline recently.Asaresult, manynetworks nowhave multiple levels of firewall, all the way down to per-host firewalls—a simpleexample ofdefense in depth.Suffice it to say that in both airports and computernetworks if attackers have tocompromise multiple independent defenses, it ismuch harder for them to breach the entire system.8.3.2 IntrusionDetection and PreventionBesides firewalls and scrubbers, network administrators may deployavarietyof other defensive measures, such as intrusion detection systems and intrusion pre-vention systems, to be described shortly.Asthe name implies, the role of anIDS(Intrusion Detection System)istodetect attacks—ideally before theycan do anydamage. For instance, theymay generate warnings early on, at the onset of an at-tack, when it observes port scanning or a brute forcessh password attack(wherean attacker simply tries manypopular passwords to try and log in), or when theIDS finds the signature of the latest and greatest exploit in a TCP connection.However, itmay also detect attacks only at a later stage, when a system has alreadybeen compromised and nowexhibits unusual behavior.We can categorize intrusion detection systems by consideringwheretheyworkandhowtheywork. AHIDS(Host-based IDS)works on the end-point itself, sayalaptop or server,and scans, for instance, the behavior of the software or the net-work traffictoand from a Web server only on that machine.In contrast, aNIDS(Network IDS)checks the trafficfor a set of machines on the network. Both haveadvantages and disadvantages.ANIDS is attractive because it protects manymachines, with the ability to cor-relate events associated with different hosts, and does not use up resources on the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 786}, page_content='SEC. 8.3FIREWALLS AND INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEMS763machines it protects. In other words, the IDS has no impact on the performance ofthe machines in its protection domain. On the other hand, it is difficult to handleissues that are system specific. As an example, suppose that a TCP connection con-tains overlapping TCP segments: packet A contains bytes 1–200 while packet Bcontains bytes 100–300. Clearly,there is overlap between the bytes in the pay-loads. Let us also assume that the bytes in the overlapping region are different.What is the IDS to do?The real question is: which bytes will be used by the receiving host? If the hostuses the bytes of packet A, the IDS should check these bytes for malicious contentand ignore the ones in packet B. However, what if the host instead uses the bytes inpacket B? And what if some hosts in the network takethe bytes in packet A andsome takethe bytes in packet B? Even if the hosts are all the same and the IDSknows howtheyreassemble the TCP streams there may still be difficulties. Sup-pose all hosts will normally takethe bytes in packet A. If the IDS looks at thatpacket, it is still wrong if the destination of the packet is twoorthree network hopsaway, and the TTL value in packet A is 1, so it neverevenreaches its destination.Tricks that attackers play with TTL, or with overlapping byte ranges in IP frag-ments or TCP segments, are calledIDS evasiontechniques.Another problem with NIDS is encryption. If the network bytes are no longerdecipherable, it becomes much harder for the IDS to determine if theyare mali-cious. This is another example of one security measure (encryption) reducing theprotection offered by another (IDS). As a work-around, administrators may givethe IDS the encryption keystothe NIDS. This works, but is not ideal, as it createsadditional key management headaches. Also, observethat the IDS seesallthe net-work trafficand tends to contain a great manylines of code itself.In other words,it may form a very juicytarget for attackers. Breakthe IDS and you get access toall network traffic!Ahost-based IDS’ drawbacks are that it uses resources at each machine onwhich it runs and that it sees only a small fraction of the events in the network. Onthe other hand, it does not suffer as much from evasion problems as it can checkthe trafficafter it has been reassembled by the very network stack of the machine itis trying to protect. Also, in cases such as IPsec, where packets encrypted and de-crypted in the network layer,the IDS may check the data after decryption.Beside the different locations of an IDS, we also have some choice inhowanIDS determines whether something poses a threat. There are twomain categories.Signature-based intrusion detection systemsuse patterns in terms of bytes or se-quences of packets that are symptoms of known attacks. If you knowthat a UDPpacket to port 53 with 10 specific bytes at the start of the payload are part of anexploitE,anIDS can easily scan the network trafficfor this pattern and raise analert when it detects it.The alert is specific: (‘‘I have detected E’’) and has a highconfidence (‘‘I knowthat it is E’’). However, with a signature-based IDS, you onlydetect threats that are known and for which a signature is available. Alternatively,an IDS may raise an alert if it seesunusualbehavior.For instance, a computer that'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 787}, page_content='764 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP.8normally only exchanges SMTP and DNS trafficwith a fewIPaddresses, suddenlystarts sending HTTP traffictomanycompletely unknown IP addresses outside thelocal network. An IDS may classify this as fishy. Since suchanomaly-basedintrusion detection systems,oranomaly detection systems for short, trigger onanyabnormal behavior,theyare capable of detecting newattacks as well as oldones. The disadvantage is that the alerts do not carry a lot of explanation. Hearingthat ‘‘something unusual happened in the network’’ismuch less specific and muchless useful than learning that ‘‘the security camera at the gate is nowattacked beingby the Hajime malware.’’AnIPS(Intrusion Prevention System)should not only detect the attack, butalso stop it. In that sense, it is a glorifiedfirewall.For instance, when the IPS seesapacket with the Hajime signature it can drop it on the floor rather than allowing itto reach the security camera. Todoso, the IPS should sit on the path towards thetarget and takedecisions about accepting or dropping traffic‘‘on the fly.’’Incon-trast, an IDS may reside elsewhere in the network, as long as we mirror all the traf-ficsoitsees it. Nowyou may ask: whybother? Whynot simply deployanIPS andbe done with the threats entirely? Part of the answer is the performance: the proc-essing at the IDS determines the speed of the data transfer.Ifyou have very littletime, you may not be able to analyze the data very deeply.More importantly,whatif you get it wrong? Specifically,what if your IPS decides a connection contains anattack anddrops it, eventhough it is benign? That is really bad if the connection isimportant, for example, when your business depends on it. It may be better to raisean alert and let someone look into it, to decide if it really was malicious.In fact, it is important to knowhow often your IDS or IPS gets it right. If itraises too manyfalse alerts (false positives)you may end up spending a lot of timeand moneychasing those. If, on the other hand, it plays conservative and oftendoes not raise alerts when attacks do takeplace (false negatives), attackers maystill easily compromise your system. The number of false positives(FPs) and falsenegatives(FNs) with respect to the true positives(TPs) and true negatives(TNs)determines the usefulness of your protection. Wecommonly express these proper-ties in terms ofprecisionandrecall.Precision represents a metric that indicateshowmanyofthe alarms that you generated were justified. In mathematical terms:P= TP/(TP+ FP). Recall indicates howmanyofthe actual attacks you detected:R= TP/(TP+ FN). Sometimes, we combine the twovalues in what is known astheF-measure:F= 2PR/(P+ R). Finally,weare sometimes simply interested inhowoften an IDS or IPS got things right. In that case, we use theaccuracyas ametric:A= (TP+ TN)/total.While it is always true that high values for recall and high precision are betterthan lowones, the number of false negativesand false positivesare typically some-what inversely correlated: if one goes down, the other goes up. However, the trade-offfor what acceptable ranges are varies from situation to situation. If you are thePentagon, you care deeply about not getting compromised. In that case, you maybe willing to chase down a fewmore false positives, as long as you do not have'),\n",

If, on the other hand, you are a school, things may be lesscritical and you may choose to not spend your moneyonanadministrator whospends most of his working days analyzing false alarms.There is one final thing we need to explain about these metrics to makeyouappreciate the importance of false positives. Wewill use an analogy similar to theone introduced by Stefan Axelsson in an influential paper that explained whyintru-sion detection is difficult (Axelsson, 1999).Suppose that there is a disease thataffects 1 in 100,000 people in practice. Anyone diagnosed with the disease dieswithin a month. Fortunately,there is a great test to see if someone is infected. Thetest has 99% accuracy: if a patient is sick (S)the test will be positive (in the medi-cal world a positive test is a bad thing!) in 99% of the cases, while for healthypatients (H), the test will be negative (Neg)in99% of the cases. One day you takethe test and, blowmedown, the test is positive (i.e., indicatesPos). The milliondollar question: howbad is this?Phrased differently: should you say goodbye tofriends and family,sell everything you own in a yard sale, and live a (short) life ofdebauchery for the remaining 30-odd days? Or not?To answer this question we should look at the math. What we are interested inis the probability that you have the disease giventhat you tested positive:P(S|Pos). What we knowis:P(Pos|S)= 0. 99P(Neg|H)= 0. 99P(S)= 0. 00001To calculateP(S|Pos), we use the famous Bayes theorem:P(S|Pos)= P(S)P(Pos|S)P(Pos)In our case, there are only twopossible outcomes for the test and twopossible out-comes for you having the disease. In other wordsP(Pos)= P(S)P(Pos|S)+ P(H)P(Pos|H)where P(H)= 1< P(S),andP(Pos|H)= 1< P(Neg|H),so that:P(Pos)= P(S)P(Pos|S)+ (1< P(S))(1< P(Neg|H))= 0. 00001*0.99+ 0. 99999*0.01so thatP(S|Pos)= 0. 00001*0.990. 00001*0.99+ 0. 99999*0.01= 0. 00098'),\n",

Noneed to panic yet. (Unless of course youdidprematurely sell all your belongings inan estate sale.)What we see here is that the final probability is strongly dominated by the falsepositive rateP(Pos|H)= 1< P(Neg|H)= 0. 01.The reason is that the number ofincidents is so small (0.00001) that all the other terms in the equation hardlycount. The problem is referred to as theBase Rate Fallacy.Ifwesubstitute‘‘under attack’’for ‘‘sick,’’ and ‘‘alert’’for ‘‘positive test,’’ wesee that the base ratefallacyisextremely important for anyIDS or IPS solution. It motivates the needfor keeping the number of false positiveslow.Besides the fundamental security principles by Saltzer and Schroeder,manypeople have offered additional, often very practical principles. One that is particu-larly useful to mention here is the pragmaticprinciple of defense in depth.Oftenit is a good idea to usemultiple complementary techniques to protect a system.Forinstance, to stop attacks, we may use a firewallandan intrusion detection sys-temandavirus scanner.While no single measure may be foolproof by itself, theidea is that it is much harder to bypass all of them at the same time.8.4 CRYPTOGRAPHYCryptographycomes from the Greek words for ‘‘secret writing.’’ Ithas a longand colorful history going back thousands of years.In this section, we will justsketch some of the highlights, as background information for what follows. For acomplete history of cryptography, Kahn’s(1995) book is recommended reading.Foracomprehensive treatment of modern security and cryptographic algorithms,protocols, and applications, and related material, see Kaufman et al.

Theysimply had Navajo Marines talkingto each other in their native language using specific Navajo words for militaryterms, for example,chay-da-gahi-nail-tsaidi(literally: tortoise killer) for antitankweapon.

Ofthese, themilitary has had the most important role and has shaped the field overthe cen-turies. Within military organizations, the messages to be encrypted have tradition-ally been giventopoorly paid, low-levelcode clerks for encryption and transmis-sion. Thesheer volume of messages prevented this work from being done by a fewelite specialists.Until the advent of computers, one of the main constraints on cryptographyhad been the ability of the code clerk to perform the necessary transformations,often on a battlefield with little equipment.An additional constraint has been thedifficulty in switching overquickly from one cryptographic method to another,since this entails retraining a large number of people.However, the danger of acode clerk being captured by the enemy has made it essential to be able to changethe cryptographic method instantly if need be.These conflicting requirementshave givenrise to the model of Fig. 8-9.\\nEncryptionmethod, E\\nPassiveintruderjustlistens Activeintrudercan altermessages\\nPlaintext, P Plaintext, PDecryptionmethod, DEncryptionkey, K Decryptionkey, KCiphertext, C = EK(P)\\nIntruder\\nFigure8-9.The encryption model (for a symmetric-key cipher).The messages to be encrypted, known as theplaintext,are transformed by afunction that is parametrized by akey.The output of the encryption process,known as theciphertext,isthen transmitted, often by messenger or radio.We as-sume that the enemy,orintruder,hears and accurately copies down the completeciphertext. However, unlikethe intended recipient, he does not knowwhat the'),\n",

Theart ofbreaking ciphers, known ascryptanalysis,and the art of devising them (crypto-graphy) are collectively known ascryptology.It will often be useful to have a notation for relating plaintext, ciphertext, andkeys. Wewill useC= EK(P)tomean that the encryption of the plaintextPusingkeyKgivesthe ciphertextC.Similarly,P= DK(C)represents the decryption ofCto get the plaintext again. Itthen follows thatDK(EK(P))= PThis notation suggests thatEandDare just mathematical functions, which theyare. Theonly trickypart is that both are functions of twoparameters, and we havewritten one of the parameters (the key)asasubscript, rather than as an argument,to distinguish it from the message.Afundamental rule of cryptographyisthat one must assume that the crypt-analyst knows the methods used for encryption and decryption.In other words, thecryptanalyst knows howthe encryption method,E,and decryption,D,ofFig. 8-9work in detail.The amount of effort necessary to invent, test, and install a newal-gorithm every time the old method is compromised (or thought to be compro-mised) has always made it impractical to keep the encryption algorithm secret.Thinking it is secret when it is not does more harm than good.This is where the key enters. Thekeyconsists of a (relatively) short string thatselects one of manypotential encryptions.In contrast to the general method,which may only be changed every fewyears, the key can be changed as often as re-quired. Thus,our basic model is a stable and publicly known general methodparametrized by a secret and easily changed key.The idea that the cryptanalystknows the algorithms and that the secrecylies exclusively in the keysiscalledKerckhoffs’ principle,named after the Dutch-born military cryptographerAuguste Kerckhoffs who first published it in a military journal 1883 (Kerckhoffs,1883). Thus,we haveKerckhoffs’ principle: all algorithms must be public; only the keysare secret.The nonsecrecyofthe algorithm cannot be emphasized enough.Trying tokeep the algorithm secret, known in the trade assecurity by obscurity,neverworks. Also,by publicizing the algorithm, the cryptographer gets free consultingfrom a large number of academic cryptologists eager to break the system so theycan publish papers demonstrating howsmart theyare. Ifmanyexperts have triedto break the algorithm for a long time after its publication and no one has suc-ceeded, it is probably pretty solid.(On the other hand, researchers have foundbugs in open source security solutions such as OpenSSL that were overadecade'),\n",

Everyone knows this, but the key issecret. Akeylength of twodigitsmeans that there are 100 possibilities.Akey length of three digits means 1000possibilities, and a key length of six digits means a million.The longer the key,thehigher thework factorthe cryptanalyst has to deal with.The work factor forbreaking the system by exhaustive search of the key space is exponential in the keylength. Secrecycomes from having a strong (but public) algorithm and a long key.To prevent your kid brother from reading your email, perhaps even64-bit keyswilldo. For routine commercial use, perhaps 256 bits should be used.To keep majorgovernments at bay,much larger keysofatleast 256 bits, and preferably more areneeded. Incidentally,these numbers are for symmetric encryption, where the en-cryption and the decryption key are the same. Wewill discuss the differences be-tween symmetric and asymmetric encryption later.From the cryptanalyst’spoint of view, the cryptanalysis problem has threeprincipal variations. Whenhe has a quantity of ciphertext and no plaintext, he isconfronted with theciphertext-onlyproblem. Thecryptograms that appear in thepuzzle section of newspapers pose this kind of problem.When the cryptanalysthas some matched ciphertext and plaintext, the problem is called theknown plain-textproblem. Finally,when the cryptanalyst has the ability to encrypt pieces ofplaintext of his own choosing, we have thechosen plaintextproblem. Newspapercryptograms could be broken trivially if the cryptanalyst were allowed to ask suchquestions as ‘‘What is the encryption of ABCDEFGHIJKL?’’Novices in the cryptographybusiness often assume that if a cipher can with-stand a ciphertext-only attack, it is secure.This assumption is very naive.Inmanycases, the cryptanalyst can makeagood guess at parts of the plaintext. For ex-ample, the first thing manycomputers say when you boot them up is ‘‘login:’’.Equipped with some matched plaintext-ciphertext pairs, the cryptanalyst’sjob be-comes much easier.Toachieve security,the cryptographer should be conservativeand makesure that the system is unbreakable evenifhis opponent can encrypt arb-itrary amounts of chosen plaintext.Encryption methods have historically been divided into twocategories: substi-tution ciphers and transposition ciphers.We will nowdeal with each of thesebriefly as background information for modern cryptography.8.4.2 Two Fundamental Cryptographic PrinciplesAlthough we will study manydifferent cryptographic systems in the pagesahead, twoprinciples underlying all of them are important to understand.Payattention. You violate them at your peril.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 793}, page_content='770 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP.8RedundancyThe first principle is that all encrypted messages must contain some redun-dancy, that is, information not needed to understand the message.An examplemay makeitclear whythis is needed.Consider a mail-order company, The CouchPotato (TCP), with 60,000 products.Thinking theyare being very efficient, TCP’sprogrammers decide that ordering messages should consist of a 16-byte customername followed by a 3-byte data field (1 byte for the quantity and 2 bytes for theproduct number).The last 3 bytes are to be encrypted using a very long keyknown only by the customer and TCP.At first, this might seem secure, and in a sense it is because passive intruderscannot decrypt the messages.Unfortunately,italso has a fatal flawthat renders ituseless. Supposethat a recently fired employee wants to punish TCP for firing her.Just before leaving, she takes the customer list with her.She works through thenight writing a program to generate fictitious orders using real customer names.Since she does not have the list of keys, she just puts random numbers in the last 3bytes, and sends hundreds of orders offtoTCP.When these messages arrive,TCP’scomputer uses the customers’ name to lo-cate the key and decrypt the message.Unfortunately for TCP,almost every 3-bytemessage is valid, so the computer begins printing out shipping instructions.Whileit might seem a bit odd for a customer to order 837 sets of children’sswings or 540sandboxes, for all the computer knows, the customer might be planning to open achain of franchised playgrounds.In this way,anactive intruder (the ex-employee)can cause a massive amount of trouble, eventhough she cannot understand themessages her computer is generating.This problem can be solved by the addition of redundancytoall messages.Forexample, if order messages are extended to 12 bytes, the first 9 of which must bezeros, this attack no longer works because the ex-employee can no longer generatealarge stream of valid messages.The moral of the story is that all messages mustcontain considerable redundancysothat active intruders cannot send random junkand have itbeinterpreted as a valid message.Thus we have:Cryptographic principle 1: Messagesmust contain some redundancyHowever, adding redundancymakes it easier for cryptanalysts to break mes-sages. Supposethat the mail-order business is highly competitive,and The CouchPotato’smain competitor,The SofaTuber,would dearly love toknowhow manysandboxes TCP is selling, so it taps TCP’sphone line.In the original scheme with3-byte messages, cryptanalysis was nearly impossible because after guessing a key,the cryptanalyst had no way of telling whether it was right because almost everymessage was technically legal. With the new12-byte scheme, it is easy for thecryptanalyst to tell a valid message from an invalid one.In other words, upon decrypting a message, the recipient must be able to tellwhether it is valid by simply inspecting the message and perhaps performing a'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 794}, page_content='SEC. 8.4 CRYPTOGRAPHY 771simple computation.This redundancyisneeded to prevent active intruders fromsending garbage and tricking the receiverinto decrypting the garbage and acting onthe ‘‘plaintext.’’However, this same redundancymakes it much easier for passive intruders tobreak the system, so there is some tension here.Furthermore, the redundancyshould neverbeinthe form ofn0s at the start or end of a message, since runningsuch messages through some cryptographic algorithms givesmore predictable re-sults, making the cryptanalysts’ job easier.ACRC polynomial (see Chapter3) ismuch better than a run of 0s since the receivercan easily verify it, but it generatesmore work for the cryptanalyst.Even better is to use a cryptographic hash, a con-cept we will explore later.For the moment, think of it as a better CRC.FreshnessThe second cryptographic principle is that measures must be taken to ensurethat each message receivedcan be verified as being fresh, that is, sent veryrecently.This measure is needed to prevent active intruders from playing back oldmessages. Ifno such measures were taken, our ex-employee could tap TCP’sphone line and just keep repeating previously sent valid messages.Thus,Cryptographic principle 2: Some method is needed to foil replay attacksOne such measure is including in every message a timestamp valid only for,say,60seconds. Thereceivercan then just keep messages around for 60 seconds andcompare newly arrivedmessages to previous ones to filter out duplicates.Mes-sages older than 60 seconds can be thrown out, since anyreplays sent more than 60seconds later will be rejected as too old.The interval should not be too short (e.g.,5seconds) because the sender’sand receiver’sclocks may be slightly out of sync.Measures other than timestamps will be discussed later.8.4.3 SubstitutionCiphersIn asubstitution cipher,each letter or group of letters is replaced by anotherletter or group of letters to disguise it.One of the oldest known ciphers is theCae-sar cipher,attributed to Julius Caesar.With this method,abecomesD,bbecomesE,cbecomesF,...,andzbecomesC.For example,attackbecomesDWWDFN.In our examples, plaintext will be giveninlowercase letters, and ciphertext inuppercase letters.Aslight generalization of the Caesar cipher allows the ciphertext alphabet tobe shifted bykletters, instead of always three.In this case,kbecomes a key tothegeneral method of circularly shifted alphabets.The Caesar cipher may have fooledPompey, but it has not fooled anyone since.The next improvement is to have each of the symbols in the plaintext, say,the26 letters for simplicity,map onto some other letter.For example,'),\n",

Incontrast with the Cae-sar cipher,trying all of them is not a promising approach.Even at 1 nsec per solu-tion, a million cores working in parallel would take10,000 years to try all the keys.Nevertheless, givenasurprisingly small amount of ciphertext, the cipher canbe broken easily.The basic attack takes advantage of the statistical properties ofnatural languages.In English, for example,eis the most common letter,followedbyt,o,a,n,i,etc. Themost common two-letter combinations, ordigrams,areth,in,er,re,andan.The most common three-letter combinations, ortrigrams,arethe,ing,and,andion.Acryptanalyst trying to break a monoalphabetic cipher would start out bycounting the relative frequencies of all letters in the ciphertext. Thenhe might ten-tatively assign the most common one toeand the next most common one tot.Hewould then look at trigrams to find a common one of the formtXe,which stronglysuggests thatXish.Similarly,ifthe patternthYtoccurs frequently,theYprobablystands fora.With this information, he can look for a frequently occurring trigramof the formaZW,which is most likelyand.Bymaking guesses at common letters,digrams, and trigrams and knowing about likely patterns of vowels and consonants,the cryptanalyst builds up a tentative plaintext, letter by letter.Another approach is to guess a probable word or phrase.Forexample, consid-er the following ciphertext from an accounting firm (blocked into groups of fivecharacters):CT BMN BYC T CBT JDS QXBNS GST JCBTSWX CTQT ZCQVUJQJ SGS TJQZZ MNQ JSVLNSX VSZJUJDS T SJQUUSJUBX JDS K SUJSNT KBGAQJ ZBGYQ TLCTZ BNY BNQJ SWAlikely word in a message from an accounting firm isfinancial.Using our know-ledge thatfinancialhas a repeated letter (i), with four other letters between theiroccurrences, we look for repeated letters in the ciphertext at this spacing.We find12 hits, at positions 6, 15, 27, 31, 42, 48, 56, 66, 70, 71, 76, and 82.However, onlytwoofthese, 31 and 42, have the next letter (corresponding tonin the plaintext)repeated in the proper place.Of these two, only 31 also has theacorrectly posi-tioned, so we knowthatfinancialbegins at position 30.From this point on, deduc-ing the key iseasy by using the frequencystatistics for English text and looking fornearly complete words to finish off.'),\n",

Ifso, the cipher isclearly a transposition cipher because in such a cipher every letter represents itself,keeping the frequencydistribution intact.The next step is to makeaguess at the number of columns.In manycases, aprobable word or phrase may be guessed at from the context. For example, sup-pose that our cryptanalyst suspects that the plaintext phrasemilliondollarsoccurssomewhere in the message.Observethat digramsMO,IL,LL,LA,IR,andOSoc-cur in the ciphertext as a result of this phrase wrapping around.The ciphertext let-terOfollows the ciphertext letterM(i.e., theyare vertically adjacent in column 4)because theyare separated in the probable phrase by a distance equal to the keylength. Ifakey oflength sevenhad been used, the digramsMD,IO,LL,LL,IA,OR,andNSwould have occurred instead.In fact, for each key length, a differentset of digrams is produced in the ciphertext. Byhunting for the various possibili-ties, the cryptanalyst can often easily determine the key length.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 797}, page_content='774 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP.8The remaining step is to order the columns.When the number of columns,k,is small, each of thek(k< 1) column pairs can be examined in turn to see if itsdigram frequencies match those for English plaintext. Thepair with the best matchis assumed to be correctly positioned.Noweach of the remaining columns is ten-tatively tried as the successor to this pair.The column whose digram and trigramfrequencies give the best match is tentatively assumed to be correct.The next col-umn is found in the same way.The entire process is continued until a potentialordering is found.Chances are that the plaintext will be recognizable at this point(e.g., ifmilloinoccurs, it is clear what the error is).Some transposition ciphers accept a fixed-length block of input and produce afixed-length block of output.These ciphers can be completely described by givingalist telling the order in which the characters are to be output.Forexample, thecipher of Fig.8-10 can be seen as a 64 character block cipher.Its output is 4, 12,20, 28, 36, 44, 52, 60, 5, 13,...,62. Inother words, the fourth input character,a,is the first to be output, followed by the twelfth,f,and so on.8.4.5 One-Time PadsConstructing an unbreakable cipher is actually quite easy; the technique hasbeen known for decades.First, choose a random bit string as the key.Then con-vert the plaintext into a bit string, for example, by using its ASCII representation.Finally,compute the XOR (eXclusive OR) of these twostrings, bit by bit.The re-sulting ciphertext cannot be broken because in a sufficiently large sample ofciphertext, each letter will occur equally often, as will every digram, every trigram,and so on.This method, known as theone-time pad,isimmune to all present andfuture attacks, no matter howmuch computational power the intruder has.Thereason derivesfrom information theory: there is simply no information in the mes-sage because all possible plaintexts of the givenlength are equally likely.An example of howone-time pads are used is giveninFig. 8-11.First, mes-sage 1, ‘‘I love you.’’ isconverted to 7-bit ASCII.Then a one-time pad, pad 1, ischosen and XORed with the message to get the ciphertext. Acryptanalyst couldtry all possible one-time pads to see what plaintext came out for each one.Forex-ample, the one-time pad listed as pad 2 in the figure could be tried, resulting inplaintext 2, ‘‘Elvis lives,’’ which may or may not be plausible (a subject beyond thescope of this book).In fact, for every 11-character ASCII plaintext, there is a one-time pad that generates it.That is what we mean by saying there is no informationin the ciphertext: you can get anymessage of the correct length out of it.One-time pads are great in theory,but have a number of disadvantages in prac-tice. Tostart with, the key cannot be memorized, so both sender and receivermustcarry a written copywith them.If either one is subject to capture, written keysareclearly undesirable.Additionally,the total amount of data that can be transmittedis limited by the amount of key available. Ifthe spystrikes it rich and discovers awealth of data, he may find himself unable to transmit them back to headquarters'),\n",

Ofcourse,at gigabit network speeds, having to insert a newDVD every 30 sec could becometedious. Andthe DVDs must be personally carried from the sender to the receiverbefore anymessages can be sent, which greatly reduces their practical utility.Also, giventhat very soon nobody will use DVD or Blu-Ray discs anymore, any-one caught carrying around a box of them should perhaps be regarded with suspi-cion.Quantum CryptographyInterestingly,there may be a solution to the problem of howtotransmit theone-time pad overthe network, and it comes from a very unlikely source: quantummechanics. Thisarea is still experimental, but initial tests are promising.If it canbe perfected and be made efficient, virtually all cryptographywill eventually bedone using one-time pads since theyare provably secure.Belowwewill brieflyexplain howthis method,quantum cryptography,works. Inparticular,wewilldescribe a protocol calledBB84after its authors and publication year (Bennet andBrassard, 1984).Suppose that a user,Alice, wants to establish a one-time pad with a seconduser,Bob.Alice and Bob are calledprincipals,the main characters in our story.Forexample, Bob is a banker with whom Alice would liketodobusiness. Thenames ‘‘Alice’’and ‘‘Bob’’havebeen used for the principals in virtually everypaper and book on cryptographysince Ron Rivest introduced them manyyears ago(Rivest et al., 1978).Cryptographers love tradition. Ifwe were to use ‘‘Andy’’and‘‘Barbara’’asthe principals, no one would believe anything in this chapter.Sobeit.If Alice and Bob could establish a one-time pad, theycould use it to communi-cate securely.The obvious question is: howcan theyestablish it without having'),\n",

Trudy can read all the bits sent in bothdirections. Shecan also send false messages in both directions.The situationmight seem hopeless for Alice and Bob, but quantum cryptographycan shed somenewlight on the subject.Quantum cryptographyisbased on the fact that light comes in microscopic lit-tle packets calledphotons,which have some peculiar properties.Furthermore,light can be polarized by being passed through a polarizing filter,afact well knownto both sunglasses wearers and photographers.If a beam of light (i.e., a stream ofphotons) is passed through a polarizing filter,all the photons emerging from it willbe polarized in the direction of the filter’saxis (e.g., vertically). Ifthe beam is nowpassed through a second polarizing filter,the intensity of the light emerging fromthe second filter is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between theaxes. Ifthe twoaxesare perpendicular,nophotons get through.The absolute ori-entation of the twofilters does not matter; only the angle between their axescounts.To generate a one-time pad, Alice needs twosets of polarizing filters. Setoneconsists of a vertical filter and a horizontal filter.This choice is called arectilin-ear basis.Abasis (plural: bases) is just a coordinate system.The second set offilters is the same, except rotated 45 degrees, so one filter runs from the lower leftto the upper right and the other filter runs from the upper left to the lower right.This choice is called adiagonal basis.Thus, Alice has twobases, which she canrapidly insert into her beam at will.In reality,Alice does not have four separatefilters, but a crystal whose polarization can be switched electrically to anyofthefour allowed directions at great speed.Bob has the same equipment as Alice.Thefact that Alice and Bob each have two bases available is essential to quantumcryptography.Foreach basis, Alice nowassigns one direction as 0 and the other as 1.In theexample presented below, weassume she chooses vertical to be 0 and horizontal tobe 1.Independently,she also chooses lower left to upper right as 0 and upper leftto lower right as 1.She sends these choices to Bob as plaintext, fully aware thatTrudy will be able to read her message.NowAlice picks a one-time pad, for example, based on a random number gen-erator (a complexsubject all by itself).She transfers it bit by bit to Bob, choosingone of her twobases at random for each bit.To send a bit, her photon gun emitsone photon polarized appropriately for the basis she is using for that bit.Forex-ample, she might choose bases of diagonal, rectilinear,rectilinear,diagonal, recti-linear,etc. Tosend her one-time pad of 1001110010100110 with these bases, shewould send the photons shown in Fig.8-12(a). Giventhe one-time pad and the se-quence of bases, the polarization to use for each bit is uniquely determined.Bitssent one photon at a time are calledqubits.'),\n",

WhenBob laterreports (in plaintext) which bases he used and Alice tells him (in plaintext) whichones are correct, Trudy nowknows when she got it right and when she got itwrong. InFig. 8-12,she got it right for bits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 13.But sheknows from Alice’sreply in Fig.8-12(d) that only bits 1, 3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14are part of the one-time pad.Forfour of these bits (1, 3, 8, and 12), she guessedright and captured the correct bit.Forthe other four (7, 10, 11, and 14), sheguessed wrong and does not knowthe bit transmitted.Thus, Bob knows the one-time pad starts with 01011001, from Fig.8-12(e) but all Trudy has is 01?1??0?,from Fig. 8-12(g).Of course, Alice and Bob are aware that Trudy may have captured part of theirone-time pad, so theywould liketoreduce the information Trudy has.Theycando this by performing a transformation on it.Forexample, theycould divide theone-time pad into blocks of 1024 bits, square each one to form a 2048-bit number,and use the concatenation of these 2048-bit numbers as the one-time pad.With herpartial knowledge of the bit string transmitted, Trudy has no way to generate itssquare and so has nothing.The transformation from the original one-time pad to adifferent one that reduces Trudy’sknowledge is calledprivacy amplification.Inpractice, complextransformations in which every output bit depends on everyinput bit are used instead of squaring.Poor Trudy.Not only does she have noidea what the one-time pad is, but herpresence is not a secret either.After all, she must relay each receivedbit to Bob totrick him into thinking he is talking to Alice.The trouble is, the best she can do istransmit the qubit she received, using the polarization she used to receive it, andabout half the time she will be wrong, causing manyerrors in Bob’sone-time pad.When Alice finally starts sending data, she encodes it using a heavy for-ward-error-correcting code.From Bob’spoint of view, a 1-bit error in the one-timepad is the same as a 1-bit transmission error.Either way,hegets the wrong bit.Ifthere is enough forward error correction, he can recoverthe original messagedespite all the errors, but he can easily count howmanyerrors were corrected.Ifthis number is far more than the expected error rate of the equipment, he knowsthat Trudy has tapped the line and can act accordingly (e.g., tell Alice to switch toaradio channel, call the police, etc.).If Trudy had a way to clone a photon so shehad one photon to inspect and an identical photon to send to Bob, she could avoiddetection, but at present no way to clone a photon perfectly is known. AndevenifTrudy could clone photons, the value of quantum cryptographytoestablish one-time pads would not be reduced.Although quantum cryptographyhas been shown to operate overdistances of60 km of fiber,the equipment is complexand expensive.Still, the idea haspromise if it can be made to scale up and become cheaper.For more informationabout quantum cryptography, see Clancyetal.

Traditionally,cryp-tographers have used simple algorithms.Nowadays, the reverse is true: the objectis to makethe encryption algorithm so complexand involuted that evenifthecryptanalyst acquires vast mounds of enciphered text of his own choosing, he willnot be able to makeany sense of it at all without the key.The first class of encryption algorithms we will study in this chapter are calledsymmetric-key algorithmsbecause theyuse the same key for encryption and de-cryption. Fig.8-9 illustrates the use of a symmetric-key algorithm. Inparticular,we will focus onblock ciphers,which takeann-bit block of plaintext as input andtransform it using the key into ann-bit block of ciphertext.Cryptographic algorithms can be implemented in either hardware (for speed)or software (for flexibility). Althoughmost of our treatment concerns the algo-rithms and protocols, which are independent of the actual implementation, a fewwords about building cryptographic hardware may be of interest.Transpositionsand substitutions can be implemented with simple electrical circuits.Figure8-13(a) shows a device, known as aP-box(P stands for permutation), used to ef-fect a transposition on an 8-bit input.If the 8 bits are designated from top to bot-tom as 01234567, the output of this particular P-box is 36071245.By appropriateinternal wiring, a P-box can be made to perform anytransposition and do it at prac-tically the speed of light since no computation is involved, just signal propagation.This design follows Kerckhoffs’ principle: the attacker knows that the generalmethod is permuting the bits.What he does not knowiswhich bit goes where.S1S2P1 P4P3P2S3S4\\nS5S6S7S8\\nProduct cipher\\n(c)\\nP-boxDecoder: 3 to 8\\nEncoder: 8 to 3\\n(b)\\nP-box\\n(a)\\nS9S10S11S12\\nFigure8-13.Basic elements of product ciphers.

Furthermore,such a device can be built in hardware to achieve greatspeed, since encoders and decoders have only one or two(subnanosecond) gatedelays and the propagation time across the P-box may well be less than 1 picosec.The real power of these basic elements only becomes apparent when we cas-cade a whole series of boxes to form aproduct cipher,asshown in Fig.8-13(c).In this example, 12 input lines are transposed (i.e., permuted) by the first stage(P1). Inthe second stage, the input is broken up into four groups of 3 bits, each ofwhich is substituted independently of the others (S1toS4). Thisarrangementshows a method of approximating a larger S-box from multiple, smaller S-boxes.It is useful because small S-boxes are practical for a hardware implementation(e.g., an 8-bit S-box can be realized as a 256-entry lookup table), but large S-boxesbecome quite unwieldy to build (e.g., a 12-bit S-box would at a minimum need212= 4096 crossed wires in its middle stage).Although this method is less gener-al, it is still powerful. Byincluding a sufficiently large number of stages in theproduct cipher,the output can be made to be an exceedingly complicated functionof the input.Product ciphers that operate onk-bit inputs to producek-bit outputs are com-mon. Onecommon value forkis 256.Ahardware implementation usually has atleast 20 physical stages, instead of just 7 as in Fig.8-13(c). Asoftware imple-mentation has a loop with at least eight iterations, each one performing S-box-typesubstitutions on subblocks of the 64- to 256-bit data block, followed by a permuta-tion that mixes the outputs of the S-boxes. Oftenthere is a special initial permuta-tion and one at the end as well.In the literature, the iterations are calledrounds.8.5.1 TheData Encryption StandardIn January 1977the U.S. Government adopted a product cipher developed byIBM as its official standard for unclassified information.This cipher,DES(DataEncryption Standard), was widely adopted by the industry for use in securityproducts. Itis no longer secure in its original form, but in a modified form it is stillused here and there. The original version was controversial because IBM specifieda128-bit key but after discussions with NSA, IBM ‘‘voluntarily’’decided to re-duce the key length to 56 bits, which cryptographers at the time said was too small.DES operates essentially as shown in Fig.8-13(c), but on bigger units.Theplaintext (in binary) is broken up into 64-bit units, and each one is encrypted sepa-rately by doing permutations and substitutions parametrized by the 56-bit key oneach of 16 consecutive rounds. In effect, it is a gigantic monoalphabetic substitu-tion cipher on an alphabet with 64-bit characters (about which more shortly).As early as 1979, IBM realized that 56 bits was much too short and devised abackward compatible scheme to increase the key length by having two56-bit keys'),\n",

(b) Decryption.Obvious questions are: (1) Whytwo keys instead of three? and (2) Whyen-cryption-decryption-encryption? Theanswer to both is that if a computer that usestriple DES has to talk to one thatuses only single DES, it can set both keystothesame value and then apply triple DES to give the same result as single DES.Thisdesign made it easier to phase in triple DES. It is basically obsolete now, but still inuse in some change-resistant applications.8.5.2 TheAdvanced Encryption StandardAs DES beganapproaching the end of its useful life, evenwith triple DES,NIST(National Institute of Standards and Technology), the agencyofthe U.S.Dept. of Commerce charged with approving standards for the U.S. Federal Govern-ment, decided that the government needed a newcryptographic standard forunclassified use.NIST was keenly aware of all the controversy surrounding DESand well knewthat if it just announced a newstandard, everyone knowing anythingabout cryptographywould automatically assume that NSA had built a back doorinto it so NSA could read everything encrypted with it.Under these conditions,probably no one would use the standard and it would have died quietly.So, NIST took a surprisingly different approach for a government bureaucracy:it sponsored a cryptographic bake-off(contest). InJanuary 1997, researchers fromall overthe world were invited to submit proposals for a newstandard, to be calledAES(Advanced Encryption Standard). Thebake-offrules were:1. Thealgorithm must be a symmetric block cipher.2. Thefull design must be public.3. Key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits must be supported.4. Bothsoftware and hardware implementations must be possible.5. Thealgorithm must be public or licensed on nondiscriminatory terms.Fifteen serious proposals were made, and public conferences were organized inwhich theywere presented and attendees were actively encouraged to find flaws in'),\n",

Even if NSA manages to build a machine with 1 billion par-allel processors, each being able to evaluate one key per picosecond, it would takesuch a machine about 1010years to search the key space. Bythen the sun will haveburned out, so the folks then present will have toread the results by candlelight.RijndaelFrom a mathematical perspective,Rijndael is based on Galois field theory,which givesitsome provable security properties.However, itcan also be viewedas C code, without getting into the mathematics.LikeDES, Rijndael uses both substitution and permutations, and it also usesmultiple rounds.The number of rounds depends on the key size and block size,being 10 for 128-bit keyswith 128-bit blocks and moving up to 14 for the largestkeyorthe largest block.However, unlikeDES, all operations involveanintegralnumber of bytes, to allowfor efficient implementations in both hardware and soft-ware. DESis bit oriented and software implementations are slowasaresult.The algorithm has been designed not only for great security,but also for greatspeed. Agood software implementation on a 2-GHz machine should be able toachieve anencryption rate of 700 Mbps, which is fast enough to encrypt overadozen 4K videos in real time.Hardware implementations are faster still.'),\n",

Thisfile consists of consecutive32-byte records, one per employee, in the format shown: 16 bytes for the name,8bytes for the position, and 8bytes for the bonus.Each of the sixteen 8-byteblocks (numbered from 0 to 15) is encrypted by (triple) DES.Name Position Bonus\\n16 8 8BytesDavis,Bobbie Janitor$ 5Collins,KimManager$100,000Black,Robin Boss $500,000Adams,Leslie Clerk $ 10\\nFigure8-15.The plaintext of a file encrypted as 16 DES blocks.Leslie just had a fight with the boss and is not expecting much of a bonus.Kim, in contrast, is the boss’ favorite, and everyone knows this.Leslie can get ac-cess to the file after it is encrypted but before it is sent to the bank.Can Leslie rec-tify this unfair situation, givenonly the encrypted file?No problem at all.All Leslie has to do is makeacopyofthe 12th ciphertextblock (which contains Kim’sbonus) and use it to replace the fourth ciphertext'),\n",

Even without knowing what the 12th blocksays, Leslie can expect to have a much merrier Christmas this year.(Copying theeighth ciphertext block is also a possibility,but is more likely to be detected;besides, Leslie is not a greedy person.)Cipher Block Chaining ModeTo thwart this type of attack, all block ciphers can be chained in various waysso that replacing a block the way Leslie did will cause the plaintext decrypted start-ing at the replaced block to be garbage. Onemethod to do so iscipher blockchaining.Inthis method, shown in Fig.8-16, each plaintext block is XORed withthe previous ciphertext block before being encrypted.Consequently,the sameplaintext block no longer maps onto the same ciphertext block, and the encryptionis no longer a big monoalphabetic substitution cipher.The first block is XORedwith a randomly chosenIV(Initialization Vector), which is transmitted (in plain-text) along with the ciphertext.\\n(a) (b)\\n+EIVKey KeyIV\\nP0\\nC0\\n+E\\nP1\\nC1\\nE\\nP2\\nC2\\nE\\nP3\\nC3\\nDC0\\nP0\\nDC1\\nP1\\nDC2\\nP2\\nDDecryptionboxEncryptionbox ExclusiveOR\\nC3\\nP3\\n++ ++++\\nFigure8-16.Cipher block chaining.

Toanastute security officer,this peculiarity might suggest where to start theensuing investigation.Cipher block chaining also has the advantage that the same plaintext block willnot result in the same ciphertext block, making cryptanalysis more difficult.

For byte-by-byte encryption,cipher feedback modeusing (triple) DES is used, as shown in Fig.8-17. ForAES, the idea is exactly the same, only a 128-bit shift register is used.In this fig-ure, the state of the encryption machine is shown after bytes 0 through 9 have beenencrypted and sent.When plaintext byte 10 arrives, as illustrated in Fig.8-17(a),the DES algorithm operates on the 64-bit shift register to generate a 64-bit cipher-text. Theleftmost byte of that ciphertext is extracted and XORed withP10.Thatbyte is transmitted on the transmission line.In addition, the shift register is shiftedleft 8 bits, causingC2to fall offthe left end, andC10is inserted in the position justvacated at the right end byC9.\\n(a)\\nKey\\nP10 C10\\nC10 C10E\\n64-bit shift registerC2C3C4C5C6C7C8C9\\nEncryptionboxSelectleftmost byteExclusive OR (b)\\nKey\\nC10 P10\\nE\\n64-bit shift registerC2C3C4C5C6C7C8C9\\n+\\nEncryptionboxSelectleftmost byte+\\nFigure8-17.Cipher feedback mode. (a) Encryption. (b) Decryption.Note that the contents of the shift register depend on the entire previous historyof the plaintext, so a pattern that repeats multiple times in the plaintext will be en-crypted differently each time in the ciphertext. Aswith cipher block chaining, aninitialization vector is needed to start the ball rolling.Decryption with cipher feedback mode works the same way as encryption.Inparticular,the content of the shift register isencrypted,notdecrypted,sothe selec-ted byte that is XORed withC10to getP10is the same one that was XORed withP10to generateC10in the first place.As long as the twoshift registers remainidentical, decryption works correctly.This is illustrated in Fig. 8-17(b).Aproblem with cipher feedback mode is that if one bit of the ciphertext is ac-cidentally inverted during transmission, the 8 bytes that are decrypted while thebad byte is in the shift register will be corrupted.Once the bad byte is pushed outof the shift register,correct plaintext will once again be generated thereafter.Thus,'),\n",

For these applications, a fourthoption,stream cipher mode,exists. Itworks by encrypting an initialization vector(IV), using a key toget an output block.The output block is then encrypted, usingthe key toget a second output block.This block is then encrypted to get a thirdblock, and so on.The (arbitrarily large) sequence of output blocks, called thekeystream,istreated likeaone-time pad and XORed with the plaintext to get theciphertext, as shown in Fig.8-18(a). Notethat the IV is used only on the first step.After that, the output is encrypted.Also, note that the keystream is independent ofthe data, so it can be computed in advance, if need be, and is completely insensitiveto transmission errors.Decryption is shown in Fig. 8-18(b).\\nE\\n(a)\\nKey\\nPlaintext CiphertextKeystream\\nEncryption boxIV\\n+\\nE\\n(b)\\nKey\\nPlaintextCiphertext Keystream\\nEncryption boxIV\\n+Figure8-18.Astream cipher.(a) Encryption.

Thus,a1-bit error in the transmitted ciphertextgenerates only a 1-bit error in the decrypted plaintext.It is essential nevertouse the same (key,IV) pair twice with a stream cipherbecause doing so will generate the same keystream each time.Using the samekeystream twice exposes the ciphertext to akeystream reuse attack.Imagine thatthe plaintext block,P0,isencrypted with the keystream to getP0XORK0.Later,asecond plaintext block,Q0,isencrypted with the same keystream to getQ0XORK0.Anintruder who captures both of these ciphertext blocks can simplyXOR them together to getP0XORQ0,which eliminates the key.The intrudernowhas the XOR of the twoplaintext blocks.If one of them is known or can bereasonably guessed, the other can also be found.In anyevent, the XOR of twoplaintext streams can be attacked by using statistical properties of the message.'),\n",

Nomatter howstrong a cryptosystem was, if an intruder couldsteal the key,the system was worthless. Cryptologistsalways took for granted thatthe encryption key and decryption key were the same (or easily derivedfrom oneanother). Butthe key had to be distributed to all users of the system.Thus, itseemed as if there was an inherent problem.Keyshad to be protected from theft,buttheyalso had to be distributed, so theycould not be locked in a bank vault.In 1976, tworesearchers at Stanford University,Diffieand Hellman (1976),proposed a radically newkind of cryptosystem, one in which the encryption anddecryption keyswere so different that the decryption key could not feasibly bederivedfrom the encryption key.Intheir proposal, the (keyed) encryption algo-rithm,E,and the (keyed) decryption algorithm,D,had to meet three requirements.These requirements can be stated simply as follows:1.D(E(P))= P.2. Itis exceedingly difficult to deduceDfromE.3.Ecannot be broken by a chosen plaintext attack.The first requirement says that if we applyDto an encrypted message,E(P), weget the original plaintext message,P,back. Without this property,the legitimatereceivercould not decrypt the ciphertext. Thesecond requirement speaks for itself.The third requirement is needed because, as we shall see in a moment, intrudersmay experiment with the algorithm to their hearts’ content.Under these condi-tions, there is no reason that the encryption key cannot be made public.The method works likethis. Aperson, say,Alice, who wants to receive secretmessages, first devises twoalgorithms meeting the above requirements. Theen-cryption algorithm and Alice’skey are then made public, hence the namepublic-keycryptography.Alice might put her public key onher home page on the Web,for example. Wewill use the notationEAto mean the encryption algorithmparametrized by Alice’spublic key.Similarly,the (secret) decryption algorithmparameterized by Alice’sprivate key isDA.Bob does the same thing, publicizingEBbutkeepingDBsecret.Nowlet us see if we can solvethe problem of establishing a secure channel be-tween Alice and Bob, who have neverhad anyprevious contact.Both Alice’sen-cryption key,EA,and Bob’sencryption key,EB,are assumed to be in publicly'),\n",

NowAlice takes her first message,P,computesEB(P), and sends itto Bob.Bob then decrypts it by applying his secret keyDB[i.e., he computesDB(EB(P))= P]. Noone else can read the encrypted message,EB(P), becausethe encryption system is assumed to be strong and because it is too difficult toderiveDBfrom the publicly knownEB.Tosend a reply,R,Bob transmitsEA(R).Alice and Bob can nowcommunicate securely.Anote on terminology is perhaps useful here.Public-key cryptographyre-quires each user to have two keys: a public key,used by the entire world for en-crypting messages to be sent to that user,and a private key,which the user needsfor decrypting messages.We will consistently refer to these keysasthepublicandprivatekeys, respectively,and distinguish them from thesecretkeys used for con-ventional symmetric-key cryptography.8.6.1 RSAThe only catch is that we need to find algorithms that indeed satisfy all threerequirements. Dueto the potential advantages of public-key cryptography, manyresearchers are hard at work, and some algorithms have already been published.One good method was discovered by a group at M.I.T.(Rivest et al., 1978).It isknown by the initials of the three discoverers (Rivest, Shamir,Adleman):RSA.Ithas survivedall attempts to break it for more than 40 years and is considered verystrong. Muchpractical security is based on it.Forthis reason, Rivest, Shamir,andAdleman were giventhe 2002 ACM Turing Award. Itsmajor disadvantage is thatit requires keysofatleast 2048 bits for good security (versus 256 bits for symmet-ric-key algorithms), which makes it quite slow.The RSA method is based on some principles from number theory.Wewillnowsummarize howtouse the method; for details, consult their paper.1.

Fortunately,mathematicians have been trying to factorlarge numbers for at least 300 years, and the accumulated evidence suggests that itis an exceedingly difficult problem.At the time,Rivest and colleagues concluded that factoring a 500-digit num-ber would require 1025years using brute force.In both cases, theyassumed thebest-known algorithm and a computer with a 1-µ sec instruction time.With a mil-lion chips running in parallel, each with an instruction time of 1 nsec, it would stilltake1016years.

Thefirst public-key algorithm was the knapsack algorithm (Merkleand Hellman, 1978).The idea here is that someone owns a very large number ofobjects, each with a different weight.The owner encodes the message by secretlyselecting a subset of the objects and placing them in the knapsack.The totalweight of the objects in the knapsack is made public, as is the list of all possibleobjects and their corresponding weights.The list of objects in the knapsack is keptsecret. With certain additional restrictions, the problem of figuring out a possiblelist of objects with the givenweight was thought to be computationally infeasibleand formed the basis of the public-key algorithm.The algorithm’sinventor,Ralph Merkle, was quite sure that this algorithmcould not be broken, so he offered a $100 reward to anyone who could break it.Adi Shamir (the ‘‘S’’inRSA) promptly brokeitand collected the reward. Unde-terred, Merkle strengthened the algorithm and offered a $1000 reward to anyonewho could break the newone. RonaldRivest (the ‘‘R’’inRSA) promptly brokethe newone and collected the reward. Merkledid not dare offer $10,000 for thenext version, so ‘‘A’’ (Leonard Adleman) was out of luck.Nevertheless, the knap-sack algorithm is not considered secure and is not used in practice anymore.Other public-key schemes are based on the difficulty of computing discretelogarithms or on elliptic curves (Menezes and Vanstone, 1993).Algorithms thatuse discrete algorithms have been invented by El Gamal (1985) and Schnorr(1991). Elliptic curves, meanwhile are based on a branch of mathematics that is notso well-known except among the elliptic curveilluminati.Afew other schemes exist, but those based on the difficulty of factoring largenumbers, computing discrete logarithms modulo a large prime, and elliptic curves,are by far the most important.These problems are thought to be genuinely difficultto solve—mathematicians have been working on them for manyyears without anygreat breakthroughs. Elliptic curves in particular enjoyalot of interest because theelliptic curvediscrete algorithm problems are evenharder than those of factoriza-tion. The Dutch mathematician Arjen Lenstra proposed a way to compare crypto-graphic algorithms by computing howmuch energy you need to break them.According to this calculation, breaking a 228-bit RSA key takes the energy equiv-alent to that needed to boil less than a teaspoon of water.Breaking an elliptic curve'),\n",

Paraphrasing Lenstra: with all water evaporated, including that inthe bodies of would-be code breakers, the problem would run out of steam.8.7 DIGITAL SIGNATURESThe authenticity of manylegal, financial, and other documents is determinedby the presence or absence of an authorized handwritten signature.And photocop-ies do not count.Forcomputerized message systems to replace the physical tran-sport of paper-and-ink documents, a method must be found to allowdocuments tobe signed in an unforgeable way.The problem of devising a replacement for handwritten signatures is a difficultone. Basically,what is needed is a system by which one party can send a signedmessage to another party in such a way that the following conditions hold:1. Thereceivercan verify the claimed identity of the sender.2. Thesender cannot later repudiate the contents of the message.3. Thereceivercannot possibly have concocted the message himself.The first requirement is needed, for example, in financial systems.When a cus-tomer’scomputer orders a bank’scomputer to buy a ton of gold, the bank’scom-puter needs to be able to makesure that the computer giving the order really be-longs to the customer whose account is to be debited.In other words, the bank hasto authenticate the customer (and the customer has to authenticate the bank).The second requirement is needed to protect the bank against fraud.Supposethat the bank buys the ton of gold, and immediately thereafter the price of golddrops sharply.Adishonest customer might then proceed to sue the bank, claimingthat he neverissued anyorder to buy gold.When the bank produces the messagein court, the customer may denyhaving sent it.The property that no party to acontract can later denyhaving signed it is callednonrepudiation.The digital sig-nature schemes that we will nowstudy help provide it.The third requirement is needed to protect the customer in the event that theprice of gold shoots up and the bank tries to construct a signed message in whichthe customer asked for one bar of gold instead of one ton.In this fraud scenario,the bank just keeps the rest of the gold for itself.8.7.1 Symmetric-Key SignaturesOne approach to digital signatures is to have a central authority that knowseverything and whom everyone trusts, say,Big Brother (BB).

Bobsays that this isamessage signed byBBthat provesAlice sentPto Bob.The judge then asksBB(whom everyone trusts) to decrypt Exhibit A.WhenBBtestifies that Bob is tellingthe truth, the judge decides in favorofBob.Case dismissed.One potential problem with the signature protocol of Fig.8-21 is Trudy replay-ing either message.To minimize this problem, timestamps are used throughout.Furthermore, Bob can check all recent messages to see ifRAwasused in anyofthem. Ifso, the message is discarded as a replay.Note that based on the time-stamp, Bob will reject very old messages.To guard against instant replay attacks,Bob just checks theRAof every incoming message to see if such a message hasbeen receivedfrom Alice in the past hour.Ifnot, Bob can safely assume this is anewrequest.8.7.2 Public-Key SignaturesAstructural problem with using symmetric-key cryptographyfor digital signa-tures is that everyone has to agree to trust Big Brother.Furthermore, Big Brothergets to read all signed messages.The most logical candidates for running the BigBrother server are the government, the banks, the accountants, and the lawyers.Unfortunately,none of these inspire total confidence in all citizens.Hence, itwould be nice if signing documents did not require a trusted authority.Fortunately,public-key cryptographycan makeanimportant contribution inthis area.Let us assume that the public-key encryption and decryption algorithmshave the property thatE(D(P))= P,inaddition, of course, to the usual propertythatD(E(P))= P.(RSA has this property,sothe assumption is not unreasonable.)Assuming that this is the case, Alice can send a signed plaintext message,P,toBob by transmittingEB(DA(P)). Notecarefully that Alice knows her own (pri-vate) key,DA,aswell as Bob’spublic key,EB,soconstructing this message issomething Alice can do.When Bob receivesthe message, he transforms it using his private key,asusual, yieldingDA(P), as shown in Fig.8-22. Hestores this text in a safe placeand then appliesEAto get the original plaintext.To see howthe signature property works, suppose that Alice subsequentlydenies having sent the messagePto Bob.When the case comes up in court, Bobcan produce bothPandDA(P). Thejudge can easily verify that Bob indeed has avalid message encrypted byDAby simply applyingEAto it.Since Bob does notknowwhat Alice’sprivate key is, the only way Bob could have acquired a messageencrypted by it is if Alice did indeed send it.While in jail for perjury and fraud,Alice will have much time to devise interesting newpublic-key algorithms.'),\n",

Dependingon the laws in her state or country,she may or may not belegally liable, especially if she claims not to have discovered the break-in until get-ting home from work, several hours after it allegedly happened.Another problem with the signature scheme is what happens if Alice decides tochange her key.Doing so is clearly legal, and it is probably a good idea to do soperiodically.Ifacourt case later arises, as described above,the judge will applythecurrent EAtoDA(P)and discoverthat it does not produceP.Bob will lookpretty stupid at this point.In principle, anypublic-key algorithm can be used for digital signatures.Thede facto industry standard is the RSA algorithm.Manysecurity products use it.However, in1991, NIST proposed using a variant of the El Gamal public-key algo-rithm for its newDigital SignatureStandard(DSS). ElGamal gets its securityfrom the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms, rather than from the difficultyof factoring large numbers.As usual when the government tries to dictate cryptographic standards, therewasanuproar.DSS was criticized for being1. Too secret (NSA designed the protocol for using El Gamal).2. Too slow(10 to 40 times slower than RSA for checking signatures).3. Too new(El Gamal had not yet been thoroughly analyzed).4. Too insecure (fixed 512-bit key).In a subsequent revision, the fourth point was rendered moot when keysupto1024bits were allowed. Nevertheless, the first twopoints remain valid.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 818}, page_content='SEC. 8.7 DIGITAL SIGNATURES 7958.7.3 MessageDigestsOne criticism of signature methods is that theyoften couple twodistinct func-tions: authentication and secrecy. Often, authentication is needed but secrecyisnotalways needed.Also, getting an export license is often easier if the system in ques-tion provides only authentication but not secrecy. Belowwewill describe anauthentication scheme that does not require encrypting the entire message.This scheme is based on the idea of a one-way hash function that takes an arbi-trarily long piece of plaintext and from it computes a fixed-length bit string.Thishash function,MD,often called amessage digest,has four important properties:1. GivenP,itiseasy to computeMD(P).2. GivenMD(P), it is effectively impossible to findP.3. GivenP,noone can findPv such thatMD(Pv )= MD(P).4. Achange to the input of even1bit produces a very different output.To meet criterion 3, the hash should be at least 128 bits long, preferably more.Tomeet criterion 4, the hash must mangle the bits very thoroughly,not unlikethesymmetric-key encryption algorithms we have seen.Computing a message digest from a piece of plaintext is much faster than en-crypting that plaintext with a public-key algorithm, so message digests can be usedto speed up digital signature algorithms.To see howthis works, consider the sig-nature protocol of Fig.8-21 again. Instead,of signingPwithKBB(A,t,P),BBnowcomputes the message digest by applyingMDtoP,yieldingMD(P).BBthen enclosesKBB(A,t,MD(P)) as the fifth item in the list encrypted withKBthatis sent to Bob, instead ofKBB(A,t,P).If a dispute arises, Bob can produce bothPandKBB(A,t,MD(P)). AfterBigBrother has decrypted it for the judge, Bob hasMD(P), which is guaranteed to begenuine, and the allegedP.However, since it is effectively impossible for Bob tofind anyother message that givesthis hash, the judge will easily be convinced thatBob is telling the truth.Using message digests in this way savesboth encryptiontime and message transport costs.Message digests work in public-key cryptosystems, too, as shown in Fig.8-23.Here, Alice first computes the message digest of her plaintext. Shethen signs themessage digest and sends both the signed digest and the plaintext to Bob.IfTrudyreplacesPalong the way,Bob will see this when he computesMD(P).SHA-1, SHA-2 and SHA-3Avariety of message digest functions have been proposed.Foralong time,one of the most widely used functions wasSHA-1(SecureHash Algorithm 1)(NIST,1993).

Sincethere is no way for Trudy to modifythe (plaintext) message while it is in transit and produce a newone that hashes toH,Bob can easily detect anychanges Trudy has made to the message.Formes-sages whose integrity is important but whose contents are not secret, the scheme ofFig. 8-24is widely used.Forarelatively small cost in computation, it guaranteesthat anymodifications made to the plaintext message in transit can be detectedwith very high probability.Newversions of SHA-1 have been developed that produce hashes of 224, 256,384, and 512 bits, respectively.Collectively,these versions are called SHA-2. Notonly are these hashes longer than SHA-1 hashes, but the digest function has beenchanged to combat some potential weaknesses of SHA-1.The weaknesses are ser-ious.

Specifically,the researchers were able to gen-eratehash collisions,essentially killing the security of SHA-1. Not surprisingly,the attack led to an increased interest in SHA-2.In 2006, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) startedorganizing a competition for a newhash standard, which is nowknown as SHA-3.The competition closed in 2012.Three years later,the newSHA-3 standard(‘‘Keccak’’) was officially published. Interestingly,NIST does not suggest that weall dump SHA-2 in the trash and switch to SHA-3 because there are no successfulattacks on SHA-2 yet. Even so, it is good to have a drop-in replacement lyingaround, just in case.8.7.4 TheBirthday AttackIn the world of crypto, nothing is everwhat it seems to be.One might thinkthat it would takeonthe order of 2moperations to subvert anm-bit message digest.In fact, 2m/2operations will often do using abirthday attack,inanapproach pub-lished by Yuval (1979) in his now-classic paper ‘‘HowtoSwindle Rabin.’’Remember,from our earlier discussion of the DNS birthday attack that if thereis some mapping between inputs and outputs withninputs (people, messages, etc.)andkpossible outputs (birthdays, message digests, etc.), there aren(n< 1)/2inputpairs. Ifn(n< 1)/2>k,the chance of having at least one match is pretty good.Thus, approximately,amatch is likely forn>3 } } k.This result means that a 64-bitmessage digest can probably be broken by generating about 232messages andlooking for twowith the same message digest.Let us look at a practical example.

Herbrowser then looks up the DNS address of Bob’shomepage and sends it aGETrequest, as shown in Fig.8-25.

Anorganization that certifies public keysis nowcalled aCA(Certification Authority).As an example, suppose that Bob wants to allowAlice and other people hedoes not knowtocommunicate with him securely.Hecan go to the CA with hispublic key along with his passport or driver’slicense and ask to be certified. TheCA then issues a certificate similar to the one in Fig.8-26 and signs its SHA-2hash with the CA’s private key.Bob then pays the CA’s fee and gets a documentcontaining the certificate and its signed hash (ideally not sent overunreliable chan-nels).Iherebycertifythat the public key19836A8B03030CF83737E3837837FC3s87092827262643FFA82710382828282Abelongs toRobertJohn Smith12345 University AvenueBerkeley, CA94702Birthday: July 4, 1958Email: bob@superdupernet.comSHA-2 hash of the above certificatesigned with the CA’sprivate keyFigure8-26.Apossible certificate and its signed hash.The fundamental job of a certificate is to bind a public key tothe name of aprincipal (individual, company, etc.).

Theresulting click would return both the certificate and the signature block (the signedSHA-2 hash of the certificate).Nowlet us run through the scenario of Fig.8-25 again. WhenTrudy interceptsAlice’srequest for Bob’shome page, what can she do?She can put her own certif-icate and signature block on the fakepage, but when Alice reads the contents of thecertificate she will immediately see that she is not talking to Bob because Bob’sname is not in it.Trudy can modify Bob’shome page on the fly,replacing Bob’spublic key with her own. However, when Alice runs the SHA-2 algorithm on thecertificate, she will get a hash that does not agree with the one she gets when sheapplies the CA’s well-known public key tothe signature block.Since Trudy doesnot have the CA’s private key,she has no way of generating a signature block thatcontains the hash of the modified Web page with her public key onit.

Ifthe owner were able to decrypt it and send it back, that would beproof that the owner indeed had the attribute stated in the certificate. Alternatively,the random number could be used to generate a session key for the ensuing conver-sation.Another example of where a certificate might contain an attribute is in an ob-ject-oriented distributed system.Each object normally has multiple methods.Theowner of the object could provide each customer with a certificate giving a bit mapof which methods the customer is allowed to invoke and binding the bit map to apublic key using a signed certificate. Again, if the certificate holder can provepossession of the corresponding private key,hewill be allowed to perform themethods in the bit map.This approach has the property that the owner’sidentityneed not be known, a property useful in situations where privacy isimportant.8.8.2 X.509If everybody who wanted something signed went to the CA with a differentkind of certificate, managing all the different formats would soon become a prob-lem. Tosolvethis problem, a standard for certificates has been devised andapprovedbythe International Telecommunication Union (ITU).The standard iscalledX.509and is in widespread use on the Internet.It has gone through threeversions since the initial standardization in 1988.We will discuss version 3.X.509 has been heavily influenced by the OSI world, borrowing some of itsworst features (e.g., naming and encoding).Surprisingly,IETF went along withX.509, eventhough in nearly every other area, from machine addresses to transportprotocols to email formats, IETF generally ignored OSI and tried to do it right.The IETF version of X.509 is described in RFC 5280.At its core, X.509 is a way to describe certificates. Theprimary fields in a cer-tificate are listed in Fig.8-27. Thedescriptions giventhere should provide a gener-al idea of what the fields do.Foradditional information, please consult the stan-dard itself or RFC 2459.Forexample, if Bob works in the loan department of the MoneyBank, hisX.500 address might be/C=US/O=MoneyBank/OU=Loan/CN=Bob/'),\n",

Itgoes under the general name ofPKI(Public Key Infrastructure). Inthis section,we will summarize howitworks in general, although there have been manypro-posals, so the details will probably evolveintime.APKI has multiple components, including users, CAs, certificates, and direc-tories. Whatthe PKI does is provide a way of structuring these components anddefine standards for the various documents and protocols.Aparticularly simpleform of PKI is a hierarchyofCAs, as depicted in Fig.8-28. Inthis example, wehave shown three levels, but in practice, there might be fewer or more.The top-levelCA, the root, certifies second-levelCAs, which we here callRAs(RegionalAuthorities)because theymight coversome geographic region, such as a countryor continent.This term is not standard, though; in fact, no term is really standardfor the different levels of the tree.These, in turn, certify the real CAs, which issuethe X.509 certificates to organizations and individuals. Whenthe root authorizes anewRA, it generates an X.509 certificate stating that it has approvedthe RA, in-cludes the newRA’ spublic key init, signs it, and hands it to the RA.Similarly,when an RA approvesanew CA, it produces and signs a certificate stating itsapprovaland containing the CA’s public key.\\nCA 1CA 2(a) (b)CA 3 CA 4CA 5\\nRA 2\\nRA 2 is approved.Its public key is47383AE349. . .Root's signatureRA 1\\nRootRA 2 is approved.Its public key is47383AE349. . .Root's signature\\nCA 5 is approved.Its public key is6384AF863B. . .RA 2's signature\\nCA 5 is approved.Its public key is6384AF863B. . .RA 2's signature\\nFigure8-28.(a) A hierarchical PKI. (b) A chain of certificates.Our PKI works likethis. Supposethat Alice needs Bob’spublic key inorderto communicate with him, so she looks for and finds a certificate containing it,signed by CA 5.But Alice has neverheard of CA 5.Forall she knows, CA 5might be Bob’s10-year-old daughter.She could go to CA 5 and say: ‘‘Prove yourlegitimacy.’’ CA5will respond with the certificate it got from RA 2, which con-tains CA 5’spublic key.Now armed with CA 5’spublic key,she can verify thatBob’scertificate was indeed signed by CA 5 and is thus legal.Unless RA 2 is Bob’s12-year-old son.So, the next step is for her to ask RA 2to prove itislegitimate. Theresponse to her query is a certificate signed by theroot andcontaining RA2’spublic key.Now Alice is sure she has Bob’spublic key.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 827}, page_content='804 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP.8But howdoes Alice find the root’spublic key?Magic. Itis assumed thateveryone knows the root’spublic key.For example, her browser might have beenshipped with the root’spublic key built in.Bob is a friendly sort of guy and does not want to cause Alice a lot of work.He knows that she will have tocheck out CA 5 and RA 2, so to save her some trou-ble, he collects the twoneeded certificates and givesher the twocertificates alongwith his.Nowshe can use her own knowledge of the root’spublic key toverify thetop-levelcertificate and the public key contained therein to verify the second one.Alice does not need to contact anyone to do the verification. Becausethe certifi-cates are all signed, she can easily detect anyattempts to tamper with their con-tents. Achain of certificates going back to the root likethis is sometimes called achain of trustor acertification path.The technique is widely used in practice.Of course, we still have the problem of who is going to run the root.The solu-tion is not to have a single root, but to have manyroots, each with its own RAs andCAs. Infact, modern browsers come preloaded with the public keysfor over100roots, sometimes referred to astrust anchors.Inthis way,having a single world-wide trusted authority can be avoided.But there is nowthe issue of howthe browser vendor decides which purportedtrust anchors are reliable and which are sleazy.Itall comes down to the user trust-ing the browser vendor to makewise choices and not simply approve all trustanchors willing to pay its inclusion fee.Most browsers allowusers to inspect theroot keys(usually in the form of certificates signed by the root) and delete anythatseem shady.For more information on PKIs, see Stapleton and Epstein (2016).DirectoriesAnother issue for anyPKI is where certificates (and their chains back to someknown trust anchor) are stored.One possibility is to have each user store his or herowncertificates. Whiledoing this is safe (i.e., there is no way for users to tamperwith signed certificates without detection), it is also inconvenient. Onealternativethat has been proposed is to use DNS as a certificate directory.Before contactingBob, Alice probably has to look up his IP address using DNS, so whynot haveDNS return Bob’sentire certificate chain along with his IP address?Some people think this is the way to go, but others would prefer dedicated di-rectory servers whose only job is managing X.509 certificates. Suchdirectoriescould provide lookup services by using properties of the X.500 names.Forex-ample, in theory,such a directory service could answer queries like‘‘Give mealistof all people named Alice who work in sales departments anywhere in the U.S.’’RevocationThe real world is full of certificates, too, such as passports and drivers’licenses. Sometimesthese certificates can be revoked, for example, drivers’licenses can be revokedfor drunken driving and other driving offenses. Thesame'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 828}, page_content='SEC. 8.8 MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC KEYS 805problem occurs in the digital world: the grantor of a certificate may decide torevoke itbecause the person or organization holding it has abused it in some way.It can also be revokedifthe subject’sprivate key has been exposed or,worse yet,the CA’s private key has been compromised.Thus, a PKI needs to deal with theissue of revocation. Thepossibility of revocation complicates matters.Afirst step in this direction is to have each CA periodically issue aCRL(Cer-tificate Revocation List)giving the serial numbers of all certificates that it hasrevoked. Sincecertificates contain expiry times, the CRL need only contain theserial numbers of certificates that have not yet expired. Onceits expiry time haspassed, a certificate is automatically invalid, so no distinction is needed betweenthose that just timed out and those that were actually revoked. Inboth cases, theycannot be used anymore.Unfortunately,introducing CRLs means that a user who is about to use a cer-tificate must nowacquire the CRL to see if the certificate has been revoked. Ifithas been, it should not be used.However, evenifthe certificate is not on the list, itmight have been revokedjust after the list was published.Thus, the only way toreally be sure is to ask the CA.And on the next use of the same certificate, the CAhas to be asked again, since the certificate might have been revokedafew secondsago.Another complication is that a revokedcertificate could conceivably be rein-stated, for example, if it was revokedfor nonpayment of some fee that has sincebeen paid.Having to deal with revocation (and possibly reinstatement) eliminatesone of the best properties of certificates, namely,that theycan be used without hav-ing to contact a CA.Where should CRLs be stored?Agood place would be the same place the cer-tificates themselves are stored.One strategy is for the CA to actively push outCRLs periodically and have the directories process them by simply removing therevokedcertificates. Ifdirectories are not used for storing certificates, the CRLscan be cached at various places around the network. SinceaCRL is itself a signeddocument, if it is tampered with, that tampering can be easily detected.If certificates have long lifetimes, the CRLs will be long, too.Forexample, ifcredit cards are valid for 5 years, the number of revocations outstanding will bemuch longer than if newcards are issued every 3 months.Astandard way to dealwith long CRLs is to issue a master list infrequently,but issue updates to it moreoften. Doingthis reduces the bandwidth needed for distributing the CRLs.8.9 AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOLSAuthenticationis the technique by which a process verifies that its communi-cation partner is who it is supposed to be and not an imposter.Verifying the identi-ty of a remote process in the face of a malicious, active intruder is surprisingly dif-ficult and requires complexprotocols based on cryptography. Inthis section, we'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 829}, page_content='806 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP.8will study some of the manyauthentication protocols that are used on insecurecomputer networks.As an aside, some people confuse authorization with authentication.Authen-tication deals with the question of whether you are actually communicating with aspecific process.Authorization is concerned with what that process is permitted todo. For example, say a client process contacts a file server and says: ‘‘I am Mirte’sprocess and I want to delete the filecookbook.old.’’From the file server’spoint ofview, two questions must be answered:1. Isthis actually Mirte’sprocess (authentication)?2. IsMirte allowed to deletecookbook.old(authorization)?Only after both of these questions have been unambiguously answered in the affir-mative can the requested action takeplace. Theformer question is really the keyone. Oncethe file server knows to whom it is talking, checking authorization isjust a matter of looking up entries in local tables or databases.Forthis reason, wewill concentrate on authentication in this section.The general model that essentially all authentication protocols use is this.Alice starts out by sending a message either to Bob or to a trusted KDC, which isexpected to be honest.Several other message exchanges followinvarious direc-tions. Asthese messages are being sent, Trudy may intercept, modify,orreplaythem in order to trick Alice and Bob or just to gum up the works.Nevertheless, when the protocol has been completed, Alice is sure she is talk-ing to Bob and Bob is sure he is talking to Alice.Furthermore, in most of the pro-tocols, the twoofthem will also have established a secretsession keyfor use in theupcoming conversation. Inpractice, for performance reasons, all data trafficisen-crypted using symmetric-key cryptography(typically AES), although public-keycryptographyiswidely used for the authentication protocols themselves and for es-tablishing the session key.The point of using a new, randomly chosen session key for each newcon-nection is to minimize the amount of trafficthat gets sent with the users’ secretkeys or public keys, to reduce the amount of ciphertext an intruder can obtain, andto minimize the damage done if a process crashes and its core dump (memoryprintout after a crash) falls into the wrong hands.Hopefully,the only key presentthen will be the session key.All the permanent keysshould have been carefullyzeroed out after the session was established.8.9.1 Authentication Based on a Shared Secret KeyForour first authentication protocol, we will assume that Alice and Bob al-ready share a secret key,KAB.This shared key might have been agreed upon onthe telephone or in person, but, in anyevent, not on the (insecure) network.'),\n",

Inthis and subsequent authentication protocols, the following notation willbe used:A,Bare the identities of Alice and Bob.Ri’s are the challenges, whereiidentifies the challenger.Ki’s are keys, whereiindicates the owner.KSis the session key.The message sequence for our first shared-key authentication protocol is illus-trated in Fig.8-29.

Alicethen encryptsthe message with the key she shares with Bob and sends the ciphertext,KAB(RB),back in message 3.When Bob sees this message, he immediately knows that itcame from Alice because Trudy does not knowKABand thus could not have gener-ated it.Furthermore, sinceRBwaschosen randomly from a large space (say,128-bit random numbers), it is very unlikely that Trudy would have seenRBand itsresponse in an earlier session.It is equally unlikely that she could guess the cor-rect response to anychallenge.

Have the initiator prove who she is before the responder has to.Thisavoids Bob giving awayvaluable information before Trudy has togive any evidence of who she is.2. Have the initiator and responder use different keysfor proof, evenifthis means having twoshared keys,KABandKv AB.3. Have the initiator and responder drawtheir challenges from differentsets.

Makethe protocol resistant to attacks involving a second parallel ses-sion in which information obtained in one session is used in a dif-ferent one.If evenone of these rules is violated, the protocol can frequently be broken. Here,all four rules were violated, with disastrous consequences.Nowlet us go takeacloser look at Fig.8-29. Surelythat protocol is not sub-ject to a reflection attack?Maybe. Itis quite subtle.Trudy was able to defeat ourprotocol by using a reflection attack because it was possible to open a second ses-sion with Bob and trick him into answering his own questions.What would hap-pen if Alice were a general-purpose computer that also accepted multiple sessions,rather than a person at a computer?Let us takealook what Trudy can do.To see howTrudy’sattack works, see Fig.8-32.

Aliceresponds to message 2 by saying in message 3: ‘‘You claim to beBob? Prove it.’’ Atthis point, Trudy is stuck because she cannot prove she is Bob.What does Trudy do now? Shegoes back to the first session, where it is herturn to send a challenge, and sends theRAshe got in message 3.Alice kindly re-sponds to it in message 5, thus supplying Trudy with the information she needs tosend in message 6 in session 2.At this point, Trudy is basically home free becauseshe has successfully responded to Alice’schallenge in session 2.She can nowcan-cel session 1, send overany old number for the rest of session 2, and she will havean authenticated session with Alice in session 2.But Trudy is a perfectionist, and she really wants to showoff her considerableskills.

(1993).Theyalso showhow itispossible to systematically construct protocols that areprovably correct.The simplest such protocol is nevertheless fairly complicated, sowe will nowshowadifferent class of protocol that also works.The newauthentication protocol is shown in Fig.8-33 (Bird et al., 1993).Ituses aHMAC(Hashed Message Authentication Code)which guarantees the in-tegrity and authenticity of a message.Asimple, yet powerful HMACconsists of ahash overthe message plus the shared key.Bysending the HMACalong with therest of the message, no attacker is able to change or spoof the message: changinganybit would lead to an incorrect hash, and generating a valid hash is not possiblewithout the key.HMACs are attractive because theycan be generated very ef-ficiently (faster than running SHA-2 and then running RSA on the result).'),\n",

TheHMACisformed by building a data structure consisting of Alice’snonce, Bob’snonce, theiridentities, and the shared secret key,KAB.This data structure is then hashed intothe HMAC, for example, using SHA-2.When Alice receivesmessage 2, she nowhasRA(which she picked herself),RB,which arrivesasplaintext, the twoidenti-ties, and the secret key,KAB,which she has known all along, so she can computethe HMACherself.

Alicepicksx= 8and Bob picksy= 10. Bothof theseare kept secret.Alice’smessage to Bob is (47, 3, 28) because 38mod 47is 28.Bob’smessage to Alice is (17).Alice computes 178mod 47,which is 4.Bobcomputes 2810mod 47,which is 4.Alice and Bob have now independently deter-mined that the secret key isnow 4.Tofind the key,Trudy nowhas to solvetheequation 3xmod 47= 28, which can be done by exhaustive search for small num-bers likethis, but not when all thenumbers are hundreds or thousands of bits long.All currently known algorithms simply takefar too long, evenonlightning-fastsupercomputers with tens of millions of cores.Despite the elegance of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, there is a problem: whenBob gets the triple (47, 3, 28), howdoes he knowitisfrom Alice and not fromTrudy?

Trudy needs some money, soshe figures out some legitimate service she can perform for Alice, makes an attrac-tive offer,and, bingo, she gets the job.After doing the work, Trudy then politelyrequests Alice to pay by bank transfer.Alice then establishes a session key withher banker,Bob.Then she sends Bob a message requesting moneytobetrans-ferred to Trudy’saccount.Meanwhile, Trudy is back to her old ways, snooping on the network. Shecop-ies both message 2 in Fig.8-36 and the money-transfer request that follows it.Later,she replays both of them to Bob who thinks: ‘‘Alice must have hired Trudyagain. Sheclearly does good work.’’ Bob then transfers an equal amount of moneyfrom Alice’saccount to Trudy’s. Sometimeafter the 50th message pair,Bob runsout of the office to find Trudy to offer her a big loan so she can expand her ob-viously successful business. Thisproblem is called thereplay attack.Several solutions to the replay attack are possible.The first one is to include atimestamp in each message.Then, if anyone receivesanold message, it can bediscarded. Thetrouble with this approach is that clocks are neverexactly synchro-nized overanetwork, so there has to be some interval during which a timestamp isvalid. Trudy can replay the message during this interval and get awaywith it.The second solution is to put a nonce in each message.Each party then has toremember all previous nonces and reject anymessage containing a previously used'),\n",

Butnonces have toberemembered forever, lest Trudy try replaying a5-year-old message.Also, if some machine crashes and it loses its nonce list, it isagain vulnerable to a replay attack.Timestamps and nonces can be combined tolimit howlong nonces have toberemembered, but clearly the protocol is going toget a lot more complicated.Amore sophisticated approach to mutual authentication is to use a multiwaychallenge-response protocol.Awell-known example of such a protocol is theNeedham-Schroeder authenticationprotocol (Needham and Schroeder,1978),one variant of which is shown in Fig. 8-37.1RA, A, B2KA(RA, B, KS, KB(A, KS))\\nKDC3\\nBob\\nAlice KB(A, KS), KS (RA2)4KS(RA2–1), RB5KS(RB–1)Figure8-37.The Needham-Schroeder authentication protocol.The protocol begins with Alice telling the KDC that she wants to talk to Bob.This message contains a large random number,RA,asanonce. TheKDC sendsback message 2 containing Alice’srandom number,asession key,and a ticket thatshe can send to Bob.The point of the random number,RA,istoassure Alice thatmessage 2 is fresh, and not a replay.Bob’sidentity is also enclosed in case Trudygets anyfunnyideas about replacingBin message 1 with her own identity so theKDC will encrypt the ticket at the end of message 2 withKTinstead ofKB.Theticket encrypted withKBis included inside the encrypted message to preventTrudy from replacing it with something else on the way back to Alice.Alice nowsends the ticket to Bob, along with a newrandom number,RA2,en-crypted with the session key,KS.Inmessage 4, Bob sends backKS(RA2< 1) toprove toAlice that she is talking to the real Bob.Sending backKS(RA2)would nothave worked, since Trudy could just have stolen it from message 3.After receiving message 4, Alice is nowconvinced that she is talking to Boband that no replays could have been used so far.After all, she just generatedRA2afewmilliseconds ago.The purpose of message 5 is to convince Bob that it isindeed Alice he is talking to, and no replays are being used here either.Byhavingeach party both generate a challenge and respond to one, the possibility of anykindof replay attack is eliminated.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 839}, page_content='816 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP.8Although this protocol seems pretty solid, it does have a slight weakness.IfTrudy evermanages to obtain an old session key inplaintext, she can initiate a newsession with Bob by replaying the message 3 that corresponds to the compromisedkeyand convince him that she is Alice (Denning and Sacco, 1981).This time shecan plunder Alice’sbank account without having to perform the legitimate serviceevenonce.Needham and Schroeder (1987) later published a protocol that corrects thisproblem. Inthe same issue of the same journal, Otway and Rees (1987) also pub-lished a protocol that solves the problem in a shorter way.Figure 8-38 shows aslightly modified Otway-Rees protocol.\\n4KA(RA, KS) 32\\nKB(RB, KS)\\nKDC\\n1\\nBob\\nAliceA, B, R, KA (A, B, R, RA)A, KA (A, B, R, RA),B, KB (A, B, R, RB)\\nFigure8-38.The Otway-Rees authentication protocol (slightly simplified).In the Otway-Rees protocol, Alice starts out by generating a pair of randomnumbers:R,which will be used as a common identifier,andRA,which Alice willuse to challenge Bob.When Bob gets this message, he constructs a newmessagefrom the encrypted part of Alice’smessage and an analogous one of his own. Boththe parts encrypted withKAandKBidentify Alice and Bob, contain the commonidentifier,and contain a challenge.The KDC checks to see if theRin both parts is the same.It might not be ifTrudy has tampered withRin message 1 or replaced part of message 2.If the twoRsmatch, the KDC believesthat the request message from Bob is valid. Itthengenerates a session key and encrypts it twice, once for Alice and once for Bob.Each message contains the receiver’srandom number,asproof that the KDC, andnot Trudy,generated the message.At this point, both Alice and Bob are in posses-sion of the same session key and can start communicating.The first time theyex-change data messages, each one can see that the other one has an identical copyofKS,sothe authentication is then complete.8.9.4 Authentication Using KerberosAn authentication protocol used in manyreal systems (including Windows) isKerberos,which is based on a variant of Needham-Schroeder.Itisnamed for amultiheaded dog in Greek mythology that used to guard the entrance to Hades'),\n",

Theprotocol has gone through several iterations.V5 is the one thatis widely used in industry and defined in RFC 4120.The earlier version, V4, wasfinally retired after serious flaws were found (Yuetal., 2004).V5 improvesonV4with manysmall changes to the protocol and some improvedfeatures, such as thefact that it no longer relies on the now-dated DES.Formore information, see Sood(2012).Kerberos involves three servers in addition to Alice (a client workstation):1. AuthenticationServer (AS): verifies users during login.2. Ticket-Granting Server (TGS): issues ‘‘proof of identity tickets.’’3. Bobthe server: actually does the work Alice wants performed.AS is similar to a KDC in that it shares a secret password with every user.TheTGS’sjob is to issue tickets that can convince the real servers that the bearer of aTGS ticket really is who he or she claims to be.To start a session, Alice sits down at an arbitrary public workstation and typesher name.The workstation sends her name and the name of the TGS to the AS inplaintext, as shown in message 1 of Fig.8-39. Whatcomes back is a session keyand a ticket,KTGS(A,KS,t), intended for the TGS.The session key isencryptedusing Alice’ssecret key,sothat only Alice can decrypt it.Only when message 2arrivesdoes the workstation ask for Alice’spassword—not before then.The pass-word is then used to generateKAin order to decrypt message 2 and obtain the ses-sion key.At this point, the workstation overwrites Alice’spassword to makesure that itis only inside the workstation for a fewmilliseconds at most.If Trudy tries log-ging in as Alice, the password she types will be wrong and the workstation willdetect this because the standard part of message 2 will be incorrect.After she logs in, Alice may tell the workstation that she wants to contact Bobthe file server.The workstation then sends message 3 to the TGS asking for aticket to use with Bob.The key element in this request is the ticketKTGS(A,KS,t),which is encrypted with the TGS’ssecret key and used as proof that the senderreally is Alice.The TGS responds in message 4 by creating a session key,KAB,forAlice to use with Bob.Two versions of it are sent back.The first is encryptedwith onlyKS,soAlice can read it.The second is another ticket, encrypted withBob’skey,KB,soBob can read it.Trudy can copymessage 3 and try to use it again, but she will be foiled by theencrypted timestamp,t,sent along with it.Trudy cannot replace the timestampwith a more recent one because she does not knowKS,the session key Alice uses'),\n",

Infact, itonly had to be in her own workstation for a fewmilliseconds. However, note thateach server does its own authorization.When Alice presents her ticket to Bob, thismerely provestoBob who sent it.Precisely what Alice is allowed to do is up toBob.Since the Kerberos designers did not expect the entire world to trust a singleauthentication server,theymade provision for having multiplerealms,each withits own AS and TGS.To get a ticket for a server in a distant realm, Alice wouldask her own TGS for a ticket accepted by the TGS in the distant realm.If the dis-tant TGS has registered with the local TGS (the same way local servers do), thelocal TGS will give Alice a ticket valid at the distant TGS.She can then do busi-ness overthere, such as getting tickets for servers in that realm.Note, however,that for parties in tworealms to do business, each one must trust the other’sTGS.Otherwise, theycannot do business.'),\n",

Therest of the chapter is abouthowthese techniques are applied in practice to provide network security,plus somethoughts about the social aspects of security at the end of the chapter.'),\n",

Anytampering done in between these twoprocesses, in-cluding within either operating system, can then be detected.The trouble with thisapproach is that it requires changing all the applications to makethem securityaware. Inthis view, the next best approach is putting encryption in the transportlayer or in a newlayer between the application layer and the transport layer,mak-ing it still end to end but not requiring applications to be changed.The opposite viewisthat users do not understand security and will not be ca-pable of using it correctly and nobody wants to modify existing programs in anyway, sothe network layer should authenticate and/or encrypt packets without theusers being involved. Afteryears of pitched battles, this viewwon enough supportthat a network layer security standard was defined. Inpart, the argument was thathaving network layer encryption does not prevent security-aware users from doingit right and it does help security-unaware users to some extent.The result of this war was a design calledIPsec(IP security), which is de-scribed in manyRFCs. Notall users want encryption (because it is computa-tionally expensive). Ratherthan makeitoptional, it was decided to require en-cryption all the time but permit the use of a null algorithm.The null algorithm isdescribed and praised for its simplicity,ease of implementation, and great speed inRFC 2410.The complete IPsec design is a framework for multiple services, algorithms,and granularities.The reason for multiple services is that not everyone wants topay the price for having all the services all the time, so the services are available ala carte.Forexample, someone streaming a movie from a remote server might notcare about encryption (although the copyright owner might).The major servicesare secrecy, data integrity,and protection from replay attacks (where the intruderreplays a conversation). Allof these are based on symmetric-key cryptographybe-cause high performance is crucial.The reason for having multiple algorithms is that an algorithm that is nowthought to be secure may be broken in the future.By making IPsec algorithm-in-dependent, the framework can survive evenifsome particular algorithm is laterbroken. Switchingto algorithm #2 is a lot easier than devising a newfamework.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 844}, page_content='SEC. 8.10 COMMUNICATION SECURITY 821The reason for having multiple granularities is to makeitpossible to protect asingle TCP connection, all trafficbetween a pair of hosts, or all trafficbetween apair of secure routers, among other possibilities.One slightly surprising aspect of IPsec is that eventhough it is in the IP layer,it is connection oriented.Actually,that is not so surprising because to have any se-curity,akey must be established and used for some period of time—in essence, akind of connection by a different name.Also, connections amortize the setup costsovermanypackets. A‘‘connection’’inthe context of IPsec is called anSA(Secu-rity Association). AnSA is a simplexconnection between twoendpoints and hasasecurity identifier associated with it.If secure trafficisneeded in both directions,twosecurity associations are required.Security identifiers are carried in packetstraveling on these secure connections and are used to look up keysand other rele-vant information when a secure packet arrives.Technically,IPsec has twoprincipal parts.The first part describes twonewheaders that can be added to packets to carry the security identifier,integrity con-trol data, and other information.The other part,ISAKMP(Internet SecurityAssociation and Key Management Protocol), deals with establishing keys.ISAKMP is a framework. Themain protocol for carrying out the work isIKE(Internet Key Exchange). Ithas gone through multiple versions as flaws havebeen corrected.IPsec can be used in either of twomodes. Intransport mode,the IPsec head-er is inserted just after the IP header.TheProtocolfield in the IP header is chang-ed to indicate that an IPsec header follows the normal IP header (before the TCPheader). TheIPsec header contains security information, primarily the SA identi-fier,anew sequence number,and possibly an integrity check of the payload.Intunnel mode,the entire IP packet, header and all, is encapsulated in thebody of a newIPpacket with a completely newIPheader.Tunnel mode is usefulwhen the tunnel ends at a location other than the final destination.In some cases,the end of the tunnel is a security gatewaymachine, for example, a companyfire-wall. Thisis commonly the case for a VPN (Virtual Private Network). Inthismode, the security gatewayencapsulates and decapsulates packets as theypassthrough it.By terminating the tunnel at this secure machine, the machines on thecompanyLAN do not have tobeaware of IPsec.Only the security gatewayhas toknowabout it.Tunnel mode is also useful when a bundle of TCP connections is aggregatedand handled as one encrypted stream because it prevents an intruder from seeingwho is sending howmanypackets to whom.Sometimes just knowing howmuchtrafficisgoing where is valuable information.Forexample, if during a militarycrisis, the amount of trafficflowing between the Pentagon and the White Housewere to drop sharply,but the amount of trafficbetween the Pentagon and somemilitary installation deep inside the Colorado RockyMountains were to increaseby the same amount, an intruder might be able to deduce some useful informationfrom these data.Studying the flowpatterns of packets, eveniftheyare encrypted,'),\n",

Itprovides integritychecking and antireplay security,but not secrecy(i.e., no data encryption).Theuse of AH in transport mode is illustrated in Fig.8-41. InIPv4, it is interposed be-tween the IP header (including anyoptions) and the TCP header.InIPv6, it is justanother extension header and is treated as such.In fact, the format is close to thatof a standard IPv6 extension header.The payload may have tobepadded out tosome particular length for the authentication algorithm, as shown.IP headerAH32 BitsSecurity parameters indexNext headerPayload len(Reserved)Sequence numberAuthentication data (HMAC)\\nTCP headerAuthenticated Payload + padding\\nFigure8-41.The IPsec authentication header in transport mode for IPv4.Let us nowexamine the AH header.TheNext headerfield is used to store thevalue that the IPProtocolfield had before it was replaced with 51 to indicate thatan AH header follows.

Inother words, the re-transmission of a packet gets a different number here than the original (eventhough its TCP sequence number is the same).The purpose of this field is to de-tect replay attacks.These sequence numbers may not wrap around.If all 232areexhausted, a newSAmust be established to continue communication.Finally,wecome toAuthentication data,which is a variable-length field thatcontains the payload’sdigital signature.When the SA is established, the twosidesnegotiate which signature algorithm theyare going to use.Normally,public-keycryptographyisnot used here because packets must be processed extremely rapidly'),\n",

Since IPsec is based on sym-metric-key cryptographyand the sender and receivernegotiate a shared key beforesetting up an security association (SA), the shared key isused in the signaturecomputation. Inother words, IPsec uses an HMAC, much likethe one we dis-cussed in the section about authentication using shared keys. Asmentioned, it ismuch faster to compute than first running SHA-2 and then running RSA on the re-sult.The AH header does not allowencryption of the data, so it is mostly usefulwhen integrity checking is needed but secrecyisnot needed.One noteworthyfea-ture of AH is that the integrity check covers some of the fields in the IP header,namely,those that do not change as the packet movesfrom router to router.TheTime to livefield changes on each hop, for example, so it cannot be included in theintegrity check.However, the IP source address is included in the check, making itimpossible for an intruder to falsify the origin of a packet.The alternative IPsec header isESP(Encapsulating Security Payload). Itsuse for both transport mode and tunnel mode is shown in Fig. 8-42.\\nESPheaderNew IPheaderOld IPheaderTCPheaderAuthenticatedPayload + padding(b) Authentication (HMAC)\\nESPheaderIPheaderTCPheaderPayload + padding(a) Authentication (HMAC)Authenticated\\nEncrypted\\nEncrypted\\nFigure8-42.(a) ESP in transport mode.

Originally,AHhandled only integrity and ESP handled only secrecy.Later,integrity was added to ESP,but the people who designed AH did not want tolet it die after all that work. Theironly real argument is that AH checks part of theIP header,which ESP does not, but other than that it is really a weak argument.Another weak argument is that a product supporting AH but not ESP might haveless trouble getting an export license because it cannot do encryption.AH is likelyto be phased out in the future.8.10.2 Virtual Private NetworksManycompanies have offices and plants scattered overmanycities, sometimesovermultiple countries.In the olden days, before public data networks, it wascommon for such companies to lease lines from the telephone companybetweensome or all pairs of locations.Some companies still do this.Anetwork built upfrom companycomputers and leased telephone lines is called aprivate network.Private networks work fine and are very secure.If the only lines available arethe leased lines, no trafficcan leak out of companylocations and intruders have tophysically wiretap the lines to break in, which is not easy to do.The problem withprivate networks is that leasing dedicated lines between twopoints is very expen-sive.When public data networks and later the Internet appeared, manycompanieswanted to move their data (and possibly voice) traffictothe public network, butwithout giving up the security of the private network.This demand soon led to the invention ofVPNs(Virtual Private Networks),which are overlay networks on top of public networks but with most of the proper-ties of private networks. Theyare called ‘‘virtual’’because theyare merely an illu-sion, just as virtual circuits are not real circuits and virtual memory is not realmemory.One popular approach is to build VPNs directly overthe Internet.Acommondesign is to equip each office with a firewall and create tunnels through the Internetbetween all pairs of offices, as illustrated in Fig.8-43(a). Afurther advantage ofusing the Internet for connectivity is that the tunnels can be set up on demand to in-clude, for example, the computer of an employee who is at home or traveling aslong as the person has an Internet connection. This flexibility is much greater thanwith a real private network with leased lines, yet from the perspective ofthe com-puters on the VPN, the topology looks just likeit, as shown in Fig.8-43(b). Whenthe system is brought up, each pair of firewalls has to negotiate the parameters ofits SA, including the services, modes, algorithms, and keys. IfIPsec is used for thetunneling, it is possible to aggregate all trafficbetween anytwo pairs of officesonto a single authenticated, encrypted SA, thus providing integrity control, secrecy,and evenconsiderable immunity to trafficanalysis. Manyfirewalls have VPNcapabilities built in. Some ordinary routers can do this as well, but since firewallsare primarily in the security business, it is natural to have the tunnels begin and endat the firewalls, providing a clear separation between the companyand the Internet.'),\n",

(b) Topology as seen from the inside.Thus, firewalls, VPNs, and IPsec with ESP in tunnel mode are a natural combina-tion and widely used in practice.Once the SAs have been established, trafficcan begin flowing. Toarouterwithin the Internet, a packet traveling along a VPN tunnel is just an ordinary pack-et. Theonly thing unusual about it is the presence of the IPsec header after the IPheader,but since these extra headers have noeffect on the forwarding process, therouters do not care about this extra header.Another approach that is gaining popularity is to have the ISP set up the VPN.Using MPLS (as discussed in Chap. 5), paths for the VPN trafficcan be set up a-cross the ISP network between the companyoffices. These paths keep the VPNtrafficseparate from other Internet trafficand can be guaranteed a certain amountof bandwidth or other quality of service.Akey advantage of a VPN is that it is completely transparent to all user soft-ware. Thefirewalls set up and manage the SAs.The only person who is evenaware of this setup is the system administrator who has to configure and managethe security gateways, or the ISP administrator who has to configure the MPLSpaths. Toeveryone else, it is likehaving a leased-line private network again. Formore about VPNs, see Ashraf (2018).8.10.3 Wireless SecurityIt is surprisingly easy to design a system using VPNs and firewalls that is logi-cally completely secure but that, in practice, leaks likeasieve.This situation canoccur if some of the machines are wireless and use radio communication, whichpasses right overthe firewall in both directions.The range of 802.11 networks canbe up to 100 meters, so anyone who wants to spyonacompanycan simply driveinto the employee parking lot in the morning, leave an802.11-enabled notebookcomputer in the car to record everything it hears, and takeoff for the day.Bylateafternoon, thedisk will be full of nice goodies.Theoretically,this leakage is notsupposed to happen.Theoretically,people are not supposed to rob banks, either.'),\n",

Itthereforegoes without saying that security is evenmore important for wireless systems thanfor wired ones.In this section, we will look at some ways wireless networks hand-le security with a focus on WiFi (802.11).Some additional information is givenbyOsterhage (2018).Part of the 802.11 standard, originally called802.11i,prescribes a data link-levelsecurity protocol for preventing a wireless node from reading or interferingwith messages sent between a pair of wireless nodes.It also goes by the tradenameWPA2(WiFi Protected Access 2). PlainWPAisaninterim scheme thatimplements a subset of 802.11i.It should be avoided in favorofWPA2. The suc-cessor to WPA2, brilliantly calledWPA3,was announced in January 2018 anduses 128-bit encryption in ‘‘personal mode’’and 192-bit encryption in ‘‘Enterprisemode.’’ WPA3has manyimprovements overWPA2, chief among which perhapswasknown as ‘‘Dragonfly,’’anoverhauled handshaketothwart certain types ofpassword guessing attacks that plague WPA2. Atthe time of writing, WPA3 is notyet as widely deployed as WPA2. Also,in April 2019 researchers disclosed an at-tack vector known as Dragonblood that removesmanyofWPA3’ssecurity advan-tages. For these reasons, we focus on WPA2 in this section.We will describe 802.11i shortly,but will first note that it is a replacement forWEP(WiredEquivalent Privacy), the first generation of 802.11 security proto-cols. WEP was designed by a networking standards committee, which is a com-pletely different process than, for example, the way NIST selected the design ofAES using a worldwide public bake-off. Theresults were devastating. What waswrong with it? Pretty much everything from a security perspective asitturns out.Forexample, WEP encrypted data for confidentiality by XORing it with the outputof a stream cipher.Unfortunately,weak keying arrangements meant that the outputwasoften reused.This led to trivial ways to defeat it. As another example, the in-tegrity check was based on a 32-bit CRC. That is an efficient code for detectingtransmission errors, but it is not a cryptographically strong mechanism for defeat-ing attackers.These and other design flaws made WEP very easy to compromise.The firstpractical demonstration that WEP was broken came when Adam Stubblefield wasan intern at AT&T (Stubblefield et al., 2002).He was able to code up and test anattack outlined by Fluhrer et al. (2001) in one week, of which most of the time wasspent convincing management to buy him a WiFi card to use in his experiments.Software to crack WEP passwords within a minute is nowfreely available and theuse of WEP is very strongly discouraged.While it does prevent casual access it'),\n",

It produced a formalstandard by June 2004.Nowwewill describe 802.11i, which does provide real security if it is set upand used properly.There are twocommon scenarios in which WPA2 is used. Thefirst is a corporate setting, in which a companyhas a separate authentication serverthat has a username and password database that can be used to determine if a wire-less client is allowed to access the network. Inthis setting, clients use standardprotocols to authenticate themselves to the network. The main standards are802.1X,with which the access point lets the client carry on a dialogue with theauthentication server and observes the result, andEAP(Extensible Authentica-tion Protocol)(RFC 3748), which tells howthe client and the authentication ser-verinteract. Actually,EAP is a framework and other standards define the protocolmessages. However, wewill not delveinto the manydetails of this exchange be-cause theydonot much matter for an overview.The second scenario is in a typical home setting in which there is no auth-entication server.Instead, there is a single shared password that is used by clientsto access the wireless network. This setup is less complexthan having an auth-entication server,which is whyitisused at home and in small businesses, but it isless secure as well. The main difference is that with an authentication server eachclient gets a key for encrypting trafficthat is not known by the other clients. With asingle shared password, different keysare derivedfor each client, but all clientshave the same password and can derive each others’ keysiftheywant to.The keysthat are used to encrypt trafficare computed as part of an authentica-tion handshake. The handshakehappens right after the client associates with awireless network and authenticates with an authentication server,ifthere is one. Atthe start of the handshake, the client has either the shared network password or itspassword for the authentication server.This password is used to derive a masterkey. However, the master key isnot used directly to encrypt packets. Itis standardcryptographic practice to derive a session key for each period of usage, to changethe key for different sessions, and to expose the master key toobservation as littleas possible. It is this session key that is computed in the handshake.The session key iscomputed with the four-packet handshakeshown inFig. 8-44.First, the AP (access point) sends a random number for identification.The client also picks its own nonce. It uses the nonces, its MACaddress and that ofthe AP,and the master key tocompute a session key,KS.The session key issplitinto portions, each of which is used for different purposes, but we have omitted thisdetail. Nowthe client has session keys, but the AP does not. So the client sends itsnonce to the AP,and the AP performs the same computation to derive the samesession keys. The nonces can be sent in the clear because the keyscannot bederivedfrom them without extra, secret information. The message from the clientis protected with an integrity check called aMIC(Message Integrity Check)based on the session key.The AP can check that the MIC is correct, and so the'),\n",

Receipt of these messages lets the client ver-ify that the AP has the correct session keys, and vice versa. The group key isusedfor broadcast and multicast trafficonthe 802.11 LAN. Because the result of thehandshakeisthat every client has its own encryption keys, none of these keyscanbe used by the AP to broadcast packets to all of the wireless clients; a separatecopywould need to be sent to each client using its key.Instead, a shared key isdis-tributed so that broadcast trafficcan be sent only once and receivedbyall the cli-ents. It must be updated as clients leave and join the network.Finally,weget to the part where the keysare actually used to provide security.Twoprotocols can be used in 802.11i to provide message confidentiality,integrity,and authentication. LikeWPA,one of the protocols, calledTKIP(TemporaryKeyIntegrity Protocol), was an interim solution. It was designed to improve se-curity on old and slow802.11 cards, so that at least some security that is betterthan WEP can be rolled out as a firmware upgrade.However, it, too, has nowbeenbroken so you are better offwith the other,recommended protocol,CCMP.Whatdoes CCMP stand for? It is short for the somewhat spectacular name Countermode with Cipher block chaining Message authentication code Protocol.We willjust call it CCMP.You can call it anything you want.CCMP works in a fairly straightforward way.Ituses AES encryption with a128-bit key and block size.

These modes are what prevent the same mes-sage from being encrypted to the same set of bits each time. Counter mode mixes acounter into the encryption. Toprovide integrity,the message, including headerfields, is encrypted with cipher block chaining mode and the last 128-bit block iskept as the MIC. Then both the message (encrypted with counter mode) and theMIC are sent. The client and the AP can each perform this encryption, or verifythis encryption when a wireless packet is received. For broadcast or multicast mes-sages, the same procedure is used with the group key.8.11 EMAILSECURITYWhen an email message is sent between twodistant sites, it will generally tran-sit dozens of machines on the way.Any ofthese can read and record the messagefor future use.In practice, privacy isnonexistent, despite what manypeople think.Nevertheless, manypeople would liketobeable to send email that can be read bythe intended recipient and no one else: not their boss and not eventheir govern-ment. Thisdesire has stimulated several people and groups to apply the crypto-graphic principles we studied earlier to email to produce secure email.In the fol-lowing sections, we will study a widely used secure email system, PGP,and thenbriefly mention one other,S/MIME.8.11.1 Pretty Good PrivacyOur first example,PGP(Pretty Good Privacy)isessentially the brainchild ofone person, Phil Zimmermann (1995).Zimmermann is a privacy advocate whosemotto is: ‘‘If privacy isoutlawed, only outlaws will have privacy.’’Released in1991, PGP is a complete email security package that provides privacy,authentica-tion, digital signatures, and compression, all in an easy-to-use form.Furthermore,the complete package, including all the source code, is distributed free of chargevia the Internet.Owing to its quality,price (zero), and easy availability on UNIX,Linux, Windows, and Mac OS platforms, it is widely used today.PGP originally encrypted data by using a block cipher calledIDEA(Interna-tional Data Encryption Algorithm), which uses 128-bit keys. Itwasdevised inSwitzerland at a time when DES was seen as tainted and AES had not yet been in-vented. Conceptually,IDEA is similar to DES and AES: it mixes up the bits in aseries of rounds, but the details of the mixing functions are different from DES andAES. Later,AES was added as an encryption algorithm and this is nowcommonlyused.PGP has also been embroiled in controversy since day 1 (Levy,1993). Be-cause Zimmermann did nothing to stop other people from placing PGP on the In-ternet, where people all overthe world could get it, the U.S. Government claimed'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 853}, page_content='830 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP.8that Zimmermann had violated U.S. laws prohibiting the export of munitions.TheU.S. Government’sinvestigation of Zimmermann went on for 5 years but waseventually dropped, probably for tworeasons. First,Zimmermann did not placePGP on the Internet himself, so his lawyer claimed thatheneverexported anything(and then there is the little matter of whether creating a Web site constitutes exportat all).Second, the government eventually came to realize that winning a trialmeant convincing a jury that a Web site containing a downloadable privacy pro-gram was covered by the arms-trafficking lawprohibiting the export of warmateriel such as tanks, submarines, military aircraft, and nuclear weapons.Yearsof negative publicity probably did not help much, either.As an aside, the export rules are bizarre, to put it mildly.The government con-sidered putting code on a Web site to be an illegalexport and harassed and threat-ened Zimmermann about it for 5 years.On the other hand, when someone publish-ed the complete PGP source code, in C, as a book (in a large font with a checksumon each page to makescanning it in easy) and then exported the book, that was finewith the government because books are not classified as munitions.The sword ismightier than the pen, at least for Uncle Sam.Another problem PGP ran into involved patent infringement.The companyholding the RSA patent, RSA Security,Inc., alleged that PGP’suse of the RSA al-gorithm infringed on its patent, but that problem was settled with releases startingat 2.6.Furthermore, PGP used another patented encryption algorithm, IDEA,whose use caused some problems at first.Since PGP is open source and freely available, various people and groups havemodified it and produced a number of versions. Someof these were designed toget around the munitions laws, others were focused on avoiding the use of patentedalgorithms, and still others wanted to turn it into a closed-source commercial prod-uct. Althoughthe munitions laws have now been slightly liberalized (otherwise,products using AES would not have been exportable from the U.S.), and the RSApatent expired in September 2000, the legacy ofall these problems is that severalincompatible versions of PGP are in circulation, under various names.The dis-cussion belowfocuses on classic PGP,which is the oldest and simplest version, ex-cept that we use AES and SHA-2 instead of IDEA and MD5 in our explanation.Another popular version, Open PGP,isdescribed in RFC 2440.Yetanother is theGNU Privacy Guard.PGP intentionally uses existing cryptographic algorithms rather than inventingnewones. Itis largely based on algorithms that have withstood extensive peerreviewand were not designed or influenced by anygovernment agencytrying toweaken them.Forpeople who distrust government, this property is a big plus.PGP supports text compression, secrecy, and digital signatures and also pro-vides extensive key management facilities, but, oddly enough, not email facilities.It is likeapreprocessor that takes plaintext as input and produces signed ciphertextin base64 as output.This output can then be emailed, of course.Some PGP im-plementations call a user agent as the final step to actually send the message.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 854}, page_content='SEC. 8.11 EMAIL SECURITY 831To see howPGP works, let us consider the example of Fig.8-45. Here,Alicewants to send a signed plaintext message,P,toBob in a secure way.PGP supportsdifferent encryption schemes such as RSA and elliptic curvecryptography, but herewe assume that both Alice and Bob have private (DX)and public (EX)RSA keys.Let us also assume that each one knows the other’spublic key;wewill coverPGPkeymanagement shortly.\\nSHA-2RSAZipAESBase64\\nRSAASCII text tothe networkP1.ZP P1\\nOriginal plaintextmessage from AliceConcatenation of P and the signed hash of P Concatenation of P1.Z encryptedwith AES and KMencrypted with EB\\nAlice’ s privateRSA key, DA\\nP1 compressed\\nBob’ s publicRSA key, EBKM: One-time message key for AES: Concatenation KM\\nFigure8-45.PGP in operation for sending a message.Alice starts out by invoking the PGP program on her computer.PGP firsthashes her message,P,using SHA-2, and then encrypts the resulting hash usingher private RSA key,DA.When Bob eventually gets the message, he can decryptthe hash with Alice’spublic key and verify that the hash is correct.Even if some-one else (e.g., Trudy) could acquire the hash at this stage and decrypt it withAlice’sknown public key,the strength of SHA-2 guarantees that it would be com-putationally infeasible to produce another message with the same SHA-2 hash.The encrypted hash and the original message are nowconcatenated into a sin-gle message,P1,and then compressed using the ZIP program, which uses the Ziv-Lempel algorithm (Zivand Lempel, 1977).Call the output of this stepP1.Z.Next, PGP prompts Alice for some random input.Both the content and thetyping speed are used to generate a 256-bit AES message key,KM(called a sessionkeyinthe PGP literature, but this is really a misnomer since there is no session).KMis nowused to encryptP1.Zwith AES.In addition,KMis encrypted withBob’spublic key,EB.These twocomponents are then concatenated and convertedto base64, as we discussed in the section on MIME in Chap. 7.The resulting mes-sage contains only letters, digits, and the symbols +, /, and =, which means it canbe put into an RFC 822 body and be expected to arrive unmodified.When Bob gets the message, he reverses the base64 encoding and decrypts theAES key using his private RSA key.Using this key,hedecrypts the message to getP1.Z.After decompressing it, Bob separates the plaintext from the encrypted hash'),\n",

Theheavy-duty encryption is done by AES, which is orders of magnitude faster than RSA.Thus, PGP provides security,compression, and a digital signature and does so in amuch more efficient way than the scheme illustrated in Fig. 8-22.PGP supports multiple RSA key lengths. It is up to the user to select the onethat is most appropriate.Forinstance, if you are a regular user,akey length of1024 bits may already be sufficient. Ifyou are worried about sophisticated govern-ment-funded three-letter organizations, perhaps 2048 bits should be the minimum.Worried about aliens whose technology is 10,000 years ahead of ours reading youremails? Thereis always the option to use 4096 bit keys. Onthe other hand, sinceRSA is only used for encrypting a fewbits, perhaps you should always go foralien-proof.The format of a classic PGP message is shown in Fig.8-46. Numerousotherformats are also in use.The message has three parts, containing the IDEA key,thesignature, and the message, respectively.The key part contains not only the key,butalso a key identifier,since users are permitted to have multiple public keys.\\nIDofEB IDofEASig.hdr hashMsghdrFilenameTime TimeTypesKM MessageEncryptedby EB DA\\nCompressed, encrypted by AESBase64Signature partMessagekey part Message part\\nR S A \\nFigure8-46.APGP message.The signature part contains a header,which will not concern us here.Theheader is followed by a timestamp, the identifier for the sender’spublic key thatcan be used to decrypt the signature hash, some type information that identifies thealgorithms used (to allowSHA-4 and RSA2 to be used when theyare invented),and the encrypted hash itself.The message part also contains a header,the default name of the file to be usedif the receiverwrites the file to the disk, a message creation timestamp, and, finally(not surprisingly), the message itself.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 856}, page_content='SEC. 8.11 EMAIL SECURITY 833Keymanagement has receivedalarge amount of attention in PGP as it is theAchilles’ heel of all security systems.Keymanagement works as follows. Eachuser maintains twodata structures locally: a private key ring and a public key ring.Theprivate key ringcontains one or more personal private/public-key pairs. Thereason for supporting multiple pairs per user is to permit users to change their pub-lic keysperiodically or when one is thought to have been compromised, withoutinvalidating messages currently in preparation or in transit.Each pair has an iden-tifier associated with it so that a message sender can tell the recipient which publickeywas used to encrypt it.Message identifiers consist of the low-order 64 bits ofthe public key.Users are themselves responsible for avoiding conflicts in theirpublic-key identifiers. Theprivate keysondisk are encrypted using a special (arbi-trarily long) password to protect them against sneak attacks.Thepublic key ringcontains public keysofthe user’scorrespondents. Theseare needed to encrypt the message keysassociated with each message.Each entryon the public key ring contains not only the public key,but also its 64-bit identifierand an indication of howstrongly the user trusts the key.The problem being tackled here is the following. Supposethat public keysaremaintained on Web sites.One way for Trudy to read Bob’ssecret email is to at-tack the Web site and replace Bob’spublic key with one of her choice.WhenAlice later fetches the key allegedly belonging to Bob, Trudy can mount a bucketbrigade (MITM)) attack on Bob.To prevent such attacks, or at least minimize the consequences of them, Aliceneeds to knowhow much to trust the item called ‘‘Bob’skey’’ onher public keyring. Ifshe knows that Bob personally handed her a CD-ROM (or a more modernstorage device) containing the key,she can set the trust value to the highest value.It is this decentralized, user-controlled approach to public-key management thatsets PGP apart from centralized PKI schemes.Nevertheless, people do sometimes obtain public keysbyquerying a trustedkeyserver.For this reason, after X.509 was standardized, PGP supported thesecertificates as well as the traditional PGP public key ring mechanism.All currentversions of PGP have X.509 support.8.11.2 S/MIMEIETF’sventure into email security,calledS/MIME(Secure/MIME), is de-scribed in RFC 2632 through RFC 2643.It provides authentication, data integrity,secrecy, and nonrepudiation.It also is quite flexible, supporting a variety ofcryptographic algorithms.Not surprisingly,giventhe name, S/MIME integrateswell with MIME, allowing all kinds of messages to be protected.Avariety of newMIME headers are defined, for example, for holding digital signatures.S/MIME does not have a rigid certificate hierarchybeginning at a single root,which had been one of the political problems that doomed an earlier system calledPEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail).Instead, users can have multiple trust anchors.As'),\n",

Inthe following sections, we will look at someof the problems and issues relating to Web security.Websecurity can be roughly divided into three parts.First, howare objectsand resources named securely?Second, howcan secure, authenticated connectionsbe established?Third, what happens when a Web site sends a client a piece of ex-ecutable code?After looking at some threats, we will examine all these issues.8.12.1 ThreatsOne reads about Web site security problems in the newspaper almost weekly.The situation is really pretty grim.Let us look at a fewexamples of what has al-ready happened.First, the home pages of numerous organizations have been at-tacked and replaced by newhome pages of the crackers’ choosing.(The popularpress calls people who break into computers ‘‘hackers,’’ but manyprogrammers re-servethat term for great programmers.We prefer to call these peoplecrackers.Sites that have been cracked include those belonging to Yahoo!, the U.S. Army,Equifax, the CIA, NASA, and theNewYork Times.Inmost cases, the crackers justput up some funnytextand the sites were repaired within a fewhours.Nowlet us look at some much more serious cases.Numerous sites have beenbrought down by denial-of-service attacks, in which the cracker floods the site withtraffic, rendering it unable to respond to legitimate queries.Often, the attack ismounted from a large number of machines that the cracker has already broken into(DDoS attacks).These attacks are so common that theydonot evenmakethenews anymore, but theycan cost the attacked sites millions of dollars in lost busi-ness.In 1999, a Swedish cracker brokeinto Microsoft’sHotmail Web site and creat-ed a mirror site that allowed anyone to type in the name of a Hotmail user and thenread all of the person’scurrent and archivedemail.In another case, a 19-year-old Russian cracker named Maxim brokeinto ane-commerce Web site and stole 300,000 credit card numbers.Then he approachedthe site owners and told them that if theydid not pay him $100,000, he would postall the credit card numbers to the Internet.Theydid not give intohis blackmail,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 858}, page_content='SEC. 8.12 WEB SECURITY 835and he indeed posted the credit card numbers, inflicting great damage on manyinnocent victims.In a different vein, a 23-year-old California student emailed a press release to anews agencyfalsely stating that the EmulexCorporation was going to post a largequarterly loss and that the CEO was resigning immediately.Within hours, thecompany’sstock dropped by 60%, causing stockholders to lose over$2billion.The perpetrator made a quarter of a million dollars by selling the stock short justbefore sending the announcement.While this event was not a Web site break-in, itis clear that putting such an announcement on the home page of anybig corpora-tion would have a similar effect.We could (unfortunately) go on likethis for manymore pages.But it is nowtime to examine some of the technical issues related to Web security.For moreinformation about security problems of all kinds, see Du (2019), Schneier (2004),and Stuttard and Pinto (2007).Searching the Internet will also turn up vast num-bers of specific cases.8.12.2 SecureNaming and DNSSECLet us revisit the problem of DNS spoofing and start with something verybasic: Alice wants to visit Bob’sWeb site.She types Bob’sURL into her browserand a fewseconds later,aWeb page appears.But is it Bob’s? Maybeyes andmaybe no.Trudy might be up to her old tricks again. For example, she might beintercepting all of Alice’soutgoing packets and examining them.When she cap-tures an HTTPGETrequest headed to Bob’sWeb site, she could go to Bob’sWebsite herself to get the page, modify it as she wishes, and return the fakepage toAlice. Alicewould be none the wiser.Worse yet, Trudy could slash the prices atBob’se-store to makehis goods look very attractive,thereby tricking Alice intosending her credit card number to ‘‘Bob’’tobuy some merchandise.One disadvantage of this classic man-in-the-middle attack is that Trudy has tobe in a position to intercept Alice’soutgoing trafficand forge her incoming traffic.In practice, she has to tap either Alice’sphone line or Bob’s, since tapping the fiberbackbone is fairly difficult. Whileactive wiretapping is certainly possible, it is afair amount of work, and while Trudy is clever, she is also lazy.Besides, there are easier ways to trick Alice, such as DNS spoofing, which weencountered previously in Sec.8.2.3. Briefly,attackers use DNS spoofing to storean incorrect mapping of a service in an intermediate name server,making it pointto the attacker’sIPaddress. When a user wants to communicate with the service, itlooks up the address, but rather than talking to the legitimate server,ends up talk-ing to the attacker.The real problem is that DNS was designed at a time when the Internet was aresearch facility for a fewhundred universities, and neither Alice, nor Bob, norTrudy was invited to the party.Security was not an issue then; making the Internetwork at all was the issue.The environment has changed radically overthe years,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 859}, page_content='836 NETWORK SECURITY CHAP.8so in 1994 IETF set up a working group to makeDNS fundamentally secure.This(ongoing) project is known asDNSSEC(DNS security); its first output was pres-ented in RFC 2535 and later updated in RFC 4033, RFC 4034, and RFC 4035among others.Unfortunately,DNSSEC has not been fully deployed yet, so numer-ous DNS servers are still vulnerable to spoofing attacks.DNSSEC is conceptually extremely simple.It is based on public-key crypto-graphy. Every DNS zone (as discussed in Chap. 7) has a public/private key pair.All information sent by a DNS server is signed with the originating zone’sprivatekey, sothe receivercan verify its authenticity.DNSSEC offers three fundamental services:1. Proofof where the data originated.2. Publickeydistribution.3. Transaction and request authentication.The main service is the first one, which verifies that the data being returned hasbeen approvedbythe zone’sowner.The second one is useful for storing andretrieving public keyssecurely.The third one is needed to guard against playbackand spoofing attacks.Note that secrecyisnot an offered service since all the infor-mation in DNS is considered public.Since phasing in DNSSEC was expected totakeseveral years, the ability for security-aware servers to interwork with securi-ty-ignorant servers was essential, which implied that the protocol could not bechanged. Letus nowlook at some of the details.DNS records are grouped into sets calledRRSETs(Resource Record SETs),with all the records having the same name, class, and type being lumped togetherin a set.An RRSET may contain multipleArecords, for example, if a DNS nameresolves to a primary IP address and a secondary IP address.The RRSETs are ex-tended with several newrecord types (discussed below). EachRRSET is crypto-graphically hashed (e.g., using SHA-2).The hash is signed by the zone’sprivatekey(e.g., using RSA).The unit of transmission to clients is the signed RRSET.Upon receipt of a signed RRSET,the client can verify whether it was signed by theprivate key ofthe originating zone.If the signature agrees, the data are accepted.Since each RRSET contains its own signature, RRSETs can be cached anywhere,evenatuntrustworthyservers, without endangering the security.DNSSEC introduces several newrecord types.The first of these is theDNSKEYrecord. Thisrecord holds the public key ofazone, user,host, or otherprincipal, the cryptographic algorithm used for signing, the protocol used for trans-mission, and a fewother bits.The public key isstored naked. X.509certificatesare not used due to their bulk. Thealgorithm field holds a 1 for MD5/RSA signa-tures and other values for other combinations.The protocol field can indicate theuse of IPsec or other security protocols, if any.The second newrecord type is theRRSIGrecord. Itholds the signed hashaccording to the algorithm specified in theDNSKEYrecord. Thesignature applies'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 860}, page_content='SEC. 8.12 WEB SECURITY 837to all the records in the RRSET,including anyDNSKEYrecords present, butexcluding itself.It also holds the times when the signature begins its period ofvalidity and when it expires, as well as the signer’sname and a fewother items.The DNSSEC design is such that a zone’sprivate key can be kept offline toprotect it.Once or twice a day,the contents of a zone’sdatabase can be manuallytransported (e.g., on a secure storage device such as the old, but fairly trustworthyCD-ROM) to a disconnected machine on which the private key islocated. AlltheRRSETs can be signed there and theRRSIGrecords thus produced can be con-veyed back to the zone’sprimary server on a secure device. Inthis way,the privatekeycan be stored on a storage device locked in a safe except when it is insertedinto the disconnected machine for signing the day’snew RRSETs. Aftersigning iscompleted, all copies of the key are erased from memory and the disk and the stor-age devices are returned to the safe.This procedure reduces electronic security tophysical security,something people understand howtodeal with.This method of presigning RRSETs greatly speeds up the process of answeringqueries since no cryptographyhas to be done on the fly.The trade-offisthat alarge amount of disk space is needed to store all the keysand signatures in theDNS databases.Some records will increase tenfold in size due to the signature.When a client process gets a signed RRSET,itmust apply the originatingzone’spublic key todecrypt the hash, compute the hash itself, and compare thetwovalues. Iftheyagree, the data are considered valid. However, this procedurebegs the question of howthe client gets the zone’spublic key.One way is to ac-quire it from a trusted server,using a secure connection (e.g., using IPsec).However, inpractice, it is expected that clients will be preconfigured with thepublic keysofall the top-leveldomains.

Nothinginvolving security is simple and this is not either.When the Web burst into public view, itwas initially used for just distributingstatic pages.However, before long, some companies got the idea of using it forfinancial transactions, such as purchasing merchandise by credit card, online bank-ing, and electronic stock trading.These applications created a demand for secureconnections. In1995, Netscape Communications Corp., the then-dominant brow-ser vendor,responded by introducing a security package calledSSL(SecureSock-ets Layer)now calledTLS(Transport Layer Security)tomeet this demand.This software and its protocol are nowwidely used, for example, by Firefox,Brave,Safari, and Chrome, so it is worth examining in some detail.SSL builds a secure connection between twosockets, including1. Parameter negotiation between client and server.2. Authenticationof the server by the client.3. Secretcommunication.4. Dataintegrity protection.We haveseen these items before, so there is no need to elaborate on them here.The positioning of SSL in the usual protocol stack is illustrated in Fig.8-48.Effectively,itisanew layer interposed between the application layer and the tran-sport layer,accepting requests from the browser and sending them down to TCPfor transmission to the server.Once the secure connection has been established,SSL’s main job is handling compression and encryption.When HTTP is used over'),\n",

It can also provide mutual authentication.Application (HTTP)Security(SSL)Transport(TCP)Network(IP)Data link (PPP)Physical (modem, ADSL, cable TV)Figure8-48.Layers (and protocols) for a home user browsing with SSL.The SSL protocol has gone through several versions. Belowwewill discussonly version 3, which is the most widely used version. SSLsupports a variety ofdifferent options.These options include the presence or absence of compression,the cryptographic algorithms to be used, and some matters relating to export re-strictions on cryptography. The last is mainly intended to makesure that seriouscryptographyisused only when both ends of the connection are in the UnitedStates. Inother cases, keysare limited to 40 bits, which cryptographers regard assomething of a joke. Netscapewasforced to put in this restriction in order to getan export license from the U.S. Government.SSL consists of twosubprotocols, one for establishing a secure connection andone for using it.Let us start out by seeing howsecure connections are established.The connection establishment subprotocol is shown in Fig.8-49. Itstarts out withmessage 1 when Alice sends a request to Bob to establish a connection.The re-quest specifies the SSL version Alice has and her preferences with respect to com-pression and cryptographic algorithms.It also contains a nonce,RA,tobeusedlater.NowitisBob’sturn. Inmessage 2, Bob makes a choice among the various al-gorithms that Alice can support and sends his own nonce,RB.Then, in message 3,he sends a certificate containing his public key.Ifthis certificate is not signed bysome well-known authority,healso sends a chain of certificates that can be follow-ed back to one.All browsers, including Alice’s, come preloaded with about 100public keys, so if Bob can establish a chain anchored to one of these, Alice will beable to verify Bob’spublic key.Atthis point, Bob may send some other messages(such as a request for Alice’spublic-key certificate). WhenBob is done, he sendsmessage 4 to tell Alice it is her turn.Alice responds by choosing a random 384-bitpremaster keyand sending it toBob encrypted with his public key (message 5).The actual session key used forencrypting data is derivedfrom the premaster key combined with both nonces in acomplexway.After message 5 has been received, both Alice and Bob are able to'),\n",

Therefore,Bob’sfirst message may well be a requestfor Alice to log in using a previously established login name and password. Thelogin protocol, however, isoutside the scope of SSL.Once it has been accom-plished, by whatevermeans, data transport can begin.As mentioned above,SSL supports multiple cryptographic algorithms.One ofthem usestriple DES with three separate keysfor encryption and SHA for mes-sage integrity.This combination is relatively slow, soitwas mostly used for bank-ing and other applications in which good security is a must.Forordinary e-com-merce applications, RC4 was often used with a 128-bit key for encryption andMD5 is used for message authentication.RC4 takes the 128-bit key asaseed andexpands it to a much larger number for internal use.Then it uses this internal num-ber to generate a keystream. Thekeystream is XORed with the plaintext to pro-vide a classical stream cipher,aswesaw inFig. 8-18.The export versions alsoused RC4 with 128-bit keys, but 88 of the bits are made public to makethe ciphereasy to break.Foractual transport, a second subprotocol is used, as shown in Fig.8-50.

Thecom-pressed fragment plus MACisthen encrypted with the agreed-on symmetric en-cryption algorithm (usually by XORing it with the RC4 keystream). Finally,afragment header is attached and the fragment is transmitted overthe TCP con-nection the usual way.\\nMessageauthenticationcode\\nHeader addedEncryptionMAC addedCompressionFragmentation Part 1 Part 2Message from browser\\nFigure8-50.Data transmission using SSL.Aword of caution is in order,however. Since it has been shown that RC4 hassome weak keysthat can be easily cryptanalyzed, the security of SSL using RC4has been on shakyground for some time already (Fluhrer et al., 2001).Browsersthat allowthe user to choose the cipher suite should be configured to use, say,triple DES with 168-bit keysand SHA-2 all the time, eventhough this combinationis slower than RC4 and MD5.Or,better yet, users should upgrade to browsers thatsupport the successor to SSL that we describe shortly.Aproblem with SSL is that Alice & Bob may not have certificates, and eveniftheydo, theydonot always verify that the keysbeing used match them.In 1996, Netscape Communications Corp. turned SSL overtoIETF for stan-dardization. Theresult wasTLS(Transport Layer Security). Itis described inRFC 5246.TLS was built on SSL version 3. The changes made to SSL were relativelysmall, but just enough that SSL version 3 and TLS cannot interoperate.Forex-ample, the way the session key isderivedfrom the premaster key and nonces waschanged to makethe key stronger (i.e., harder to cryptanalyze).Because of this'),\n",

One particularly difficult problem is that we more and more allowforeign, untrusted code to run on our local machines. Wewill nowtakeaquickpeek at some of the issues raised by such untrusted code and some approaches todealing with it.Scripting Code in the BrowserIn the early days, when Web pages were just static HTML files, theydid notcontain executable code.Nowtheyoften contain small programs, typically writteninJavaScript(and sometimes compiled to the more efficientWebAssembly).Downloading and executing suchmobile codeis obviously a massive security risk,so various methods have been devised to minimize it.JavaScript does not have any formal security model, but it does have a longhistory of leakyimplementations. Eachvendor handles security in a different way.The main defense is that, barring bugs, the language should not be able to do verybad things—read or write arbitrary files, access the sensitive data of other Webpages, etc.We commonly say that such code runs in asandboxed environment.The problem is that bugs do exist.The fundamental problem is that letting foreign code run on your machine isasking for trouble.From a security standpoint, it is likeinviting a burglar into yourhouse and then trying to watch him carefully so he cannot escape from the kitcheninto the living room.If something unexpected occurs and you are distracted for amoment, bad things can happen.The tension here is that mobile code allowsflashygraphics and fast interaction, and manyWeb site designers think that this ismuch more important than security,especially when it is somebody else’smachineat risk.Forinstance, imagine that a Web site containing your personal data allows youto provide feedback in the form of arbitrary text that is visible to every other user.The idea is that users can nowtell the companyhow much theylikeorhate its ser-vices. However, unless that Web site very carefully sanitizes the data in the feed-back form, an attacker could also place a small amount of JavaScript in the textfield. Nowimagine that you visit the Web site and look at the feedback providedby other users. The JavaScript will be sent to your browser which has no idea that'),\n",

It just sees JavaScript, just likeitfinds on manyother Web pages, and starts executing it. The malicious JavaScript is able to stealall the privacy-sensitive data (e.g., cookies) that your browser maintains for thisWebsite and send it to the criminal. This is known as aCSS(cross-site scripting)attack.CSRF(Cross-Site Request Forgery)attacks, which are related, can evenallowanattacker to pose as a user.Another problem that may arise is that the JavaScript engine may not be assecure as it should be. For instance, there may be a bug in the browser that mali-cious JavaScript code can use to takeoverthe browser,orperhaps eventhe entiresystem. Thisis known as adrive-by download:you visit a Web site and withoutrealizing it, you are infected. It does not evenmean that the Web site wasmalicious—perhaps the JavaScript was in an advertisement or in some feedbackfield, as we sawearlier.Aparticular famous attack, known asOperation Aurorawasthe attack on Google and several other tech companies, where the attackersused a drive-by download to spread through the companywith an eye towards get-ting access to its code repositories.Browser ExtensionsAs well as extending Web pages with code, there is a booming marketplace inbrowser extensions,add-ons,andplug-ins.Theyare computer programs that ex-tend the functionality of Web browsers. Plug-ins often provide the capability tointerpret or display a certain type of content, such as PDFs or Flash animations.Extensions and add-ons provide newbrowser features, such as better passwordmanagement, or ways to interact with pages by,for example, marking them up orenabling easy shopping for related items.Installing an extension, add-on, or plug-in is as simple as coming across some-thing you want when browsing and following the link to install the program. Thisaction will cause code to be downloaded across the Internet and installed into thebrowser.All of these programs are written to frameworks that differ depending onthe browser that is being enhanced. However, toafirst approximation, theybecomepart of the trusted computing base of the browser.That is, if the code that is in-stalled is buggy,the entire browser can be compromised.There are twoother obvious failure modes as well. The first is that the programmay behave maliciously,for example, by gathering personal information and send-ing it to a remote server.For all the browser knows, the user installed the extensionfor precisely this purpose. The second problem is that plug-ins give the browser theability to interpret newtypes of content. Often this content is a full-blown pro-gramming language itself. PDF and Flash are good examples. Whenusers viewpages with PDF and Flash content, the plug-ins in their browser are executing thePDF and Flash code. That code had better be safe; often there are vulnerabilitiesthat it can exploit. For all of these reasons, add-ons and plug-ins should only be in-stalled as needed and only from trusted vendors.'),\n",

Whenmalicious codestarts executing, it usually starts out by infecting other programs (either on disk orrunning programs in memory).When one of these programs is run, it is runningmalicious code. It may spread itself to other machines, encrypt all your documentson disk (for ransom), spyonyour activities, and manyother unpleasant things.Some malware infects the boot sector of the hard disk, so when the machine isbooted, the malware gets to run.Malware become a huge problem on the Internetand have caused billions of dollars’ worth of damage.There is no obvious solu-tion. Perhapsawhole newgeneration of operating systems based on secure micro-kernels and tight compartmentalization of users, processes, and resources mighthelp.8.13 SOCIALISSUESThe Internet and its security technology is an area where social issues, publicpolicy, and technology meet head-on, often with huge consequences.Belowwewill just briefly examine three areas: privacy,freedom of speech, and copyright.Needless to say,wecan only scratch the surface. For additional reading, seeAnderson (2008a), Baase and Henry (2017), Bernal (2018), and Schneier (2004).The Internet is also full of material.Just type words such as ‘‘privacy,’’‘‘censor-ship,’’ and ‘‘copyright’’into anysearch engine.8.13.1 Confidential and Anonymous CommunicationDo people have a right to privacy?Good question.The Fourth Amendment tothe U.S. Constitution prohibits the government from searching people’shouses,papers, and effects without good reason, and goes on to restrict the circumstancesunder which search warrants shall be issued.Thus, privacy has been on the publicagenda for over200 years, at least in the U.S.What has changed in the past decade is both the ease with which governmentscan spyontheir citizens and the ease with which the citizens can prevent such spy-ing. Inthe 18th century,for the government to search a citizen’spapers, it had tosend out a policeman on a horse to go to the citizen’sfarm demanding to see cer-tain documents.It was a cumbersome procedure.Nowadays, telephone com-panies and Internet providers readily provide wiretaps when presented with searchwarrants. Itmakes life much easier for the policeman and there is no danger offalling offahorse.'),\n",

Manypeople carry around a smartphone that contains information abouttheir entire life.Some smartphones can be unlocked using facial recognition soft-ware. This has the consequence that if a police officer wants to have a suspectunlock his phone and the suspect refuses, all the officer has to do is hold the phonein front of the suspect’sface, and bingo, the phone unlocks. Very fewpeople thinkabout this scenario when enabling face recognition (or its predecessor,fingerprintrecognition).Cryptographychanges all that.Anybody who goes to the trouble of download-ing and installing PGP and who uses a well-guarded alien-strength key can befairly sure that nobody in the known universe can read his email, search warrant orno search warrant. Governments well understand this and do not likeit. Realpri-vacy means it is much harder for them to spyoncriminals of all stripes, but it isalso much harder to spyonjournalists and political opponents.Consequently,some governments restrict or forbid the use or export of cryptography. InFrance,for example, prior to 1999, all cryptographywas banned unless the governmentwasgiventhe keys.France was not alone.In April 1993, the U.S. Government announced itsintention to makeahardware cryptoprocessor,theclipper chip,the standard for allnetworked communication.It was said that this would guarantee citizens’ privacy.It also mentioned that the chip provided the government with the ability to decryptall trafficvia a scheme calledkeyescrow,which allowed the government access toall the keys. However, the government promised only to snoop when it had a validsearch warrant. Needlessto say,ahuge furor ensued, with privacy advocates de-nouncing the whole plan and lawenforcement officials praising it.Eventually,thegovernment backed down and dropped the idea.Alarge amount of information about electronic privacy isavailable at the Elec-tronic Frontier Foundation’sWeb site,www.eff.org.Anonymous RemailersPGP,SSL, and other technologies makeitpossible for twoparties to establishsecure, authenticated communication, free from third-party surveillance and inter-ference. However, sometimes privacy isbest served bynothaving authentication,in fact, by making communication anonymous. Theanonymity may be desired forpoint-to-point messages, newsgroups, or both.Let us consider some examples. First,political dissidents living under authori-tarian regimes often wish to communicate anonymously to escape being jailed orkilled. Second,wrongdoing in manycorporate, educational, governmental, andother organizations has often been exposed by whistleblowers, who frequently pre-fer to remain anonymous to avoid retribution.

Fourth, people may wish to discussalcoholism, mental illness, sexual harassment, child abuse, or being a member of apersecuted minority in a newsgroup without having to go public.Numerous otherexamples exist, of course.Let us consider a specific example. Inthe 1990s, some critics of a nontradi-tional religious group posted their views to a USENET newsgroup via ananony-mous remailer.This server allowed users to create pseudonyms and send email tothe server,which then remailed or re-posted them using the pseudonyms, so no onecould tell where the messages really came from.Some postings revealed what thereligious group claimed were trade secrets and copyrighted documents.The reli-gious group responded by telling local authorities that its trade secrets had beendisclosed and its copyright infringed, both of which were crimes where the serverwaslocated. Acourt case followed and the server operator was compelled to turnoverthe mapping information that revealed the true identities of the persons whohad made the postings.(Incidentally,this was not the first time that a religiousgroup was unhappywhen someone leaked its trade secrets: William Tyndale wasburned at the stakein1536 for translating the Bible into English.)Asubstantial segment of the Internet community was completely outraged bythis breach of confidentiality.The conclusion that everyone drewisthat an anony-mous remailer that stores a mapping between real email addresses and pseudonyms(nowcalled a type 1 remailer) is not worth anything at all.This case stimulatedvarious people into designing anonymous remailers that could withstand subpoenaattacks.These newremailers, often calledcypherpunk remailers,work as follows.The user produces an email message, complete with RFC 822 headers (exceptFr om:,ofcourse), encrypts it with the remailer’spublic key,and sends it to theremailer.There the outer RFC 822 headers are stripped off, the content is de-crypted and the message is remailed.The remailer has no accounts and maintainsno logs, so evenifthe server is later confiscated, it retains no trace of messagesthat have passed through it.Manyusers who wish anonymity chain their requests through multiple anony-mous remailers, as shown in Fig.8-51. Here,Alice wants to send Bob a really,really,really anonymous Valentine’sDay card, so she uses three remailers.Shecomposes the message,M,and puts a header on it containing Bob’semail address.Then she encrypts the whole thing with remailer 3’spublic key,E3(indicated byhorizontal hatching).To this she prepends a header with remailer 3’semail addressin plaintext. Thisis the message shown between remailers 2 and 3 in the figure.Then she encrypts this message with remailer 2’spublic key,E2(indicated byvertical hatching) and prepends a plaintext header containing remailer 2’semail ad-dress. Thismessage is shown between 1 and 2 in Fig.8-51. Finally,she encryptsthe entire message with remailer 1’spublic key,E1,and prepends a plaintext head-er with remailer 1’semail address.This is the message shown to the right of Alicein the figure and this is the message she actually transmits.'),\n",

For a de-scription of this kind of remailer,see the classic paper by Mazie`res and Kaashoek(1998).Anonymity is not restricted to email.Services also exist that allowanonymousWebsurfing using the same form of layered path in which one node only knowsthe next node in the chain. This method is calledonion routingbecause each nodepeels offanother layer of the onion to determine where to forward the packet next.The user configures his browser to use the anonymizer service as a proxy.Tor is awell-known example of such a system (Bernaschi et al., 2019).Henceforth, allHTTP requests go through the anonymizer network, which requests the page andsends it back.The Web site sees an exit node of the anonymizer network as thesource of the request, not the user.Aslong as the anonymizer network refrainsfrom keeping a log, no one can determine who requested which page. also not inthe face of a subpoena since the information simply is not there.8.13.2 Freedom of SpeechAnonymous communication makes it harder for other people to see detailsabout their private communications.Asecond key social issue is freedom ofspeech, and its opposite, censorship, which is about governments wanting torestrict what individuals can read and publish.With the Web containing millions'),\n",

Manualsfor picking locks, building nuclear weapons, encryptingmessages, etc.The usual response is to ban the ‘‘bad’’sites.Sometimes the results are unexpected. For example, some public librarieshave installed Web filters on their computers to makethem child friendly by block-ing pornographysites. Thefilters veto sites on their blacklists but also check pagesfor dirty words before displaying them.In one case in Loudoun County,Virginia,the filter blocked a patron’ssearch for information on breast cancer because the fil-ter sawthe word ‘‘breast.’’ The library patron sued Loudoun County.However, inLivermore, California, a parent sued the public library fornotinstalling a filterafter her 12-year-old son was caught viewing pornographythere. What’salibraryto do?It has escaped manypeople that the World Wide Web is aworldwideWeb. Itcovers the whole world. Notall countries agree on what should be allowed on theWeb. For example, in November 2000, a French court ordered Yahoo!, a corpora-tion located in California, to block French users from viewing auctions of Nazimemorabilia on Yahoo!’sWeb site because owning such material violates Frenchlaw. Yahoo! appealed to a U.S. court, which sided with it, but the issue of whoselaws apply where is far from settled.Incidentally,for manyyears, Yahoo! was one of the darlings of the Internetcompanies, but nothing lasts foreverand in 2017 it was announced that Verizonwould buy it for close to 5 billion dollars. The price was reduced with 350 milliondollars as a direct result of a series of data breaches at Yahoo! whereby the ac-counts of billions of users were affected.

Someof these systems are Freenet (Clarkeetal.,2002), PASIS (Wylie et al., 2000), and Publius (Waldman et al., 2000).Of increasing concern is not only the filtering or censorship of information, butalso the spread of so-calleddisinformation,orinformation that is deliberatelycrafted to be false. Disinformationis nowatactic that attackers can use to swaypolitical, social, and financial outcomes.In 2016, attackers famously authored dis-information sites pertaining to United States presidential candidates and dissemi-nated them on social media. In other contexts, disinformation has been used toattempt to sway real estate prices for investors. Unfortunately,detecting disinfor-mation is challenging, and doing so before it spreads is evenmore challenging.SteganographyIn countries where censorship abounds, dissidents often try to use technologyto evade it.Cryptographyallows secret messages to be sent (although possibly notlawfully), but if the government thinks that Alice is a Bad Person, the mere factthat she is communicating with Bob may get him put in this category,too, asrepressive governments understand the concept of transitive closure, eveniftheyare short on mathematicians.Anonymous remailers can help, but if theyarebanned domestically and messages to foreign ones require a government exportlicense, theycannot help much.But the Web can.People who want to communicate secretly often try to hide the fact that anycommunication at all is taking place.The science of hiding messages is calledsteganography,from the Greek words for ‘‘covered writing.’’ Infact, the ancientGreeks used it themselves.

Thisphotograph, taken by one of theauthors (AST) in Kenya, contains three zebras contemplating an acacia tree.Fig-ure 8-52(b) appears to be the same three zebras and acacia tree, but it has an extraadded attraction.It contains the complete, unabridged text of fiveof Shakespeare’splays embedded in it:Hamlet,King Lear,Macbeth,The Merchant of Venice,andJulius Caesar.Together,these plays total over700 KB of text.\\n(a) (b)Figure8-52.(a) Three zebras and a tree.

Eachpixel consists of three 8-bit numbers, one each for thered, green, and blue intensity of that pixel. Thepixel’scolor is formed by the lin-ear superposition of the three colors.The steganographic encoding method usesthe low-order bit of each RGB color value as a covert channel.Thus, each pixelhas room for 3 bits of secret information, 1 in the red value, 1 in the green value,and 1 in the blue value. With an image of this size, up to 1024× 768× 3bits or294,912 bytes of secret information can be stored in it.The full text of the fiveplays and a short notice add up to 734,891 bytes.Thistext was first compressed to about 274 KB using a standard compression algo-rithm. Thecompressed output was then encrypted using IDEA and inserted intothe low-order bits of each color value. Ascan be seen (or actually,cannot beseen), the existence of the information is completely invisible. Itis equally invisi-ble in the large, full-color version of the photo.The eye cannot easily distinguish21-bit color from 24-bit color.Viewing the twoimages in black and white with lowresolution does not dojustice to howpowerful the technique is.To get a better feeling for howsteganog-raphyworks, we have prepared a demonstration, including the full-color high-'),\n",

Tosee howyou can embed an audio recordingin a still image, see Chaudhary and Chaudbe (2018).Images are by no means the only carrier for steganographic messages.Audiofiles also work fine. Hidden information can be carried in a voice-over-IP call bymanipulating the packet delays, distorting the audio, or eveninthe header fields ofpackets (Lubacz et al., 2010).Even the layout and ordering of tags in an HTMLfile can carry information.Although we have examined steganographyinthe context of free speech, it hasnumerous other uses.One common use is for the owners of images to encodesecret messages in them stating their ownership rights.If such an image is stolenand placed on a Web site, the lawful owner can reveal the steganographic messagein court to prove whose image it is.This technique is calledwatermarking.Itisdiscussed in Muyco and Hernandez (2019).Steganographyisanactive research area, with entire conferences devoted tothe topic.Some interesting papers include Hegarty and Keane (2018), Kumar(2018), and Patil et al.

TheGutenbergProject (www.gutenberg.org), for example, hasplaced over50,000 public-domain works (e.g., by Shakespeare, Mark Twain, andCharles Dickens) on the Web.In1998, the U.S. Congress extended copyright inthe U.S. by another 20 years at the request of Hollywood, which claimed that with-out an extension nobody would create anything anymore.

Byway of contrast, patents last for only 20years and people still invent things.Copyright came to the forefront when Napster,amusic-swapping service, had50 million members.Although Napster did not actually copyany music, the courtsheld that its holding a central database of who had which song was contributoryinfringement, that is, it was helping other people infringe.While nobody seriouslyclaims copyright is a bad idea (although manyclaim that the term is far too long,favoring big corporations overthe public), the next generation of music sharing isalready raising major ethical issues.Forexample, consider a peer-to-peer network in which people share legalfiles(public-domain music, home videos, religious tracts that are not trade secrets, etc.)and perhaps a fewthat may be copyrighted. Assumethat everyone is online all thetime via ADSL or cable.Each machine has an indexofwhat is on the hard disk,plus a list of other members.Someone looking for a specific item can pick a ran-dom member and see if he has it.If not, he can check out all the members in thatperson’slist, and all the members in their lists, and so on.Computers are verygood at this kind of work. Having found the item, the requester just copies it.If the work is copyrighted, chances are the requester is infringing (although forinternational transfers, the question of whose lawapplies matters because in somecountries uploading is illegalbut downloading is not).But what about the sup-plier? Isit a crime to keep music you have paid for and legally downloaded onyour hard disk where others might find it?If you have anunlocked cabin in thecountry and a thief sneaks in carrying a notebook computer and scanner,scans acopyrighted book to the notebook’shard disk, and sneaks out, areyouguilty of thecrime of failing to protect someone else’scopyright?But there is more trouble brewing on the copyright front.There is a huge bat-tle going on nowbetween Hollywood and the computer industry.The formerwants stringent protection of all intellectual property but the latter does not want tobe Hollywood’spoliceman. InOctober 1998, Congress passed theDMCA(Digi-tal Millennium Copyright Act), which makes it a crime to circumvent anyprotec-tion mechanism present in a copyrighted work or to tell others howtocircumventit. Similarlegislation has been enacted in the European Union.While virtually noone thinks that pirates in the Far East should be allowed to duplicate copyrightedworks, manypeople think that the DMCA completely shifts the balance betweenthe copyright owner’sinterest and the public interest.Acase in point: in September 2000, a music industry consortium charged withbuilding an unbreakable system for selling music online sponsored a contest invit-ing people to try to break the system (which is precisely the right thing to do withanynew security system).Ateam of security researchers from several universities,led by Prof. Edward Felten of Princeton, took up the challenge and brokethe sys-tem. Theythen wrote a paper about their findings and submitted it to a USENIXsecurity conference, where it underwent peer reviewand was accepted.Before the'),\n",

Fearingadefini-tive court ruling against it, the industry reluctantly withdrewits threat and the courtdismissed Felten’ssuit. Nodoubt the industry was motivated by the weakness ofits case: it had invited people to try to break its system and then threatened to suesome of them for accepting its own challenge.With the threat withdrawn, thepaper was published (Craveretal., 2001).Anew confrontation is virtually certain.Meanwhile, peer-to-peer networks have been used to exchange copyrightedcontent. Inresponse, copyright holders have used the DMCA to send automatednotices calledDMCA takedown noticesto users and ISPs.The copyright holdersinitially notified (and sued) individuals directly,which provedunpopular and inef-fective.Now theyare suing the ISPs for not terminating customers who are violat-ing the DMCA.This is a trickyproposition, since peer-to-peer networks oftenhave peers that lie about what theyare sharing (Cuevasetal., 2014; and Santos etal., 2011) and your printer may evenbemistaken for a culprit (Piatek et al., 2008),butthe copyright holders are having some success with this approach: in December2019, a federal court ordered Cox Communications to pay $1 billion to the copy-right holders for not properly responding to takedown notices.Arelated issue is the extent of thefair use doctrine,which has been estab-lished by court rulings in various countries.This doctrine says that purchasers of acopyrighted work have certain limited rights to copythe work, including the rightto quote parts of it for scientific purposes, use it as teaching material in schools orcolleges, and in some cases makebackup copies for personal use in case the origi-nal medium fails. Thetests for what constitutes fair use include (1) whether theuse is commercial, (2) what percentage of the whole is being copied, and (3) theeffect of the copying on sales of the work. Sincethe DMCA and laws within theEuropean Union prohibit circumvention of copyprotection schemes, these lawsalso prohibit legalfair use.In effect, the DMCA takes awayhistorical rights fromusers to give content sellers more power.Ashowdown is inevitable.Another development in the works that dwarfs eventhe DMCA in its shiftingof the balance between copyright owners and users istrusted computingas advo-cated by industry bodies such as theTCG(Trusted Computing Group), led bycompanies likeIntel and Microsoft.The idea is to provide support for carefullymonitoring user behavior in various ways (e.g., playing pirated music) at a levelbelowthe operating system in order to prohibit unwanted behavior.This is accom-plished with a small chip, called aTPM(Trusted Platform Module), which it isdifficult to tamper with.Some PCs sold nowadays come equipped with a TPM.The system allows software written by content owners to manipulate PCs in waysthat users cannot change.This raises the question of who is trusted in trusted com-puting.

Unfortunately,itisoften difficult tograsp in the sense that it ishard to specify exactly howsecure a system is. Whatwe can do is rigorously apply security principles such as thoseof Saltzer andSchroeder.Meanwhile, adversaries will try to compromise a system by combining thefundamental building blocks reconnaissance (what is running where under whatconditions), sniffing (eavesdropping on traffic), spoofing (pretending to be some-one else), and disruption (denial-of-service). All of these building blocks can growto be extremely advanced. Toprotect against these attacks and combinationsthereof, network administrators install firewalls, intrusion detection systems andintrusion prevention systems. Such solutions may be deployed in the network aswell as at the host and may work on the basis of signatures or anomalies. Eitherway, the number of false positives(false alerts) and false negatives(attacks missed)are important measures for the usefulness of such solutions. Especially if attacksare rare and there are manyevents, the Base Rate Fallacydictates that false posi-tivesrate quickly reduces the power of an intrusion detection system.Cryptographyisatool that can be used to keep information confidential and toensure its integrity and authenticity.All modern cryptographic systems are basedon Kerckhoffs’ principle of having a publicly known algorithm and a secret key.Manycryptographic algorithms use complextransformations involving substitu-tions and permutations to transform the plaintext into the ciphertext. However, ifquantum cryptographycan be made practical, the use of one-time pads may pro-vide truly unbreakable cryptosystems.Cryptographic algorithms can be divided into symmetric-key algorithms andpublic-key algorithms. Symmetric-key algorithms mangle the bits in a series ofrounds parametrized by the key toturn the plaintext into the ciphertext. AES(Rijndael) and triple DES are some of the most popular symmetric-key algorithmsat present.These algorithms can be used in electronic code book mode, cipherblock chaining mode, stream cipher mode, counter mode, and others.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Text Book dir/CN.pdf', 'page': 878}, page_content='SEC. 8.14 SUMMARY 855Public-key algorithms have the property that different keysare used for en-cryption and decryption and that the decryption key cannot be derivedfrom the en-cryption key.These properties makeitpossible to publish the public key.One ofthe main public-key algorithms is RSA, which derivesits strength from the factthat it is difficult to factor large numbers. ECC-based algorithms are also used.Legal, commercial, and other documents need to be signed.Accordingly,vari-ous schemes have been devised for digital signatures, using both symmetric-keyand public-key algorithms. Commonly,messages to be signed are hashed using al-gorithms such asSHA-2 or SHA-3, and then the hashes are signed rather than theoriginal messages.Public-key management can be done using certificates, which are documentsthat bind a principal to a public key.Certificates are signed by a trusted authorityor by someone (recursively) approvedbyatrusted authority.The root of the chainhas to be obtained in advance, but browsers generally have manyroot certificatesbuilt into them.These cryptographic tools can be used to secure network traffic. IPsecoper-ates in the network layer,encrypting packet flows from host to host.Firewalls canscreen trafficgoing into or out of an organization, often based on the protocol andport used.Virtual private networks can simulate an old leased-line network to pro-vide certain desirable security properties.Finally,wireless networks need good se-curity lest everyone read all the messages, and protocols like802.11i provide it.Defense in depth, using multiple defense mechanisms, is always a good idea.When twoparties establish a session, theyhaveto authenticate each other and,if need be, establish a shared session key.Various authentication protocols exist,including some that use a trusted third party,Diffie-Hellman, Kerberos, and pub-lic-key cryptography.Email security can be achievedbyacombination of the techniques we havestudied in this chapter.PGP,for example, compresses messages, then encryptsthem with a secret key and sends the secret key encrypted with the receiver’spub-lic key.Inaddition, it also hashes the message and sends the signed hash to verifymessage integrity.Websecurity is also an important topic, starting with secure naming.DNSSEC provides a way to prevent DNS spoofing. Moste-commerce Web sitesuse TLS to establish secure, authenticated sessions between the client and server.Various techniques are used to deal with mobile code, especially sandboxing andcode signing.Finally,the Internet raises manyissues in which technology interacts stronglywith public policy. Some of the areas include privacy,freedom of speech, andcopyright. Addressing these issues requires contribution from multiple disciplines.Giventhe speed at which technology evolves and the speed at which legislationand public policyevolve, we will stick out our necks and predict that these issueswill not be solved by the time the next edition of this book is in print.In case weare wrong, we will buy all our readers a wheel of cheese.'),\n",

For a nontechnical and fascinating discussion of com-puter security in the broadest sense, this book is a very good read.Skoudis and Liston,Counter HackReloaded,2nd ed.The best way to stop a hacker is to think likeahacker.This book shows howhackers see a network, and argues that security should be a function of the entirenetwork’sdesign, not an afterthought based on one specific technology.Itcoversalmost all common attacks, including the ‘‘social engineering’’types that takeadvantage of users who are not always familiar with computer security measures.Ye etal., ‘‘A Survey onMalware Detection Using Data Mining Techniques’’Malware is everywhere and most computers run antivirus or antimalware soft-ware. Howdothe vendors of these programs detect and classify malware? Thissurvey paper looks at the malware and antimalware industries and howmalwarecan be detected by data mining.9.2 ALPHABETICALBIBLIOGRAPHYABRAMSON, N.:‘‘Internet Access Using VSATs,’’IEEE Commun.

This resource sharing technically occurs at the linklayer,not the physical layer,although we will coveritinthis chapter for the sakeofcontinuity.2.7.4 Resource Sharing in DOCSIS Networks: Nodes and MinislotsThere is one important fundamental difference between the HFC system ofFig. 2-45(a)and the telephone system of Fig.2-45(b).

In essence, the bandwidth that agivensubscriber receivesatany givenmoment depends quite a bit on the usage ofsubscribers who happen to be sharing the same cable, as we describe in more detailbelow.Cable ISPs have tackled this problem by splitting up long cables and con-necting each one directly to a fiber node.

Convolutional codes are effectiveat handling isolated bit errors, but theywill fail, likely with a burst of errors, ifthere are too manyerrors in the receivedbit stream.By adding a Reed-Solomoncode within the convolutional code, the Reed-Solomon decoding can mop up theerror bursts, a task at which it is very good.

Inthe downstream direction, a full code-word has up to 2027 bytes, of which up to 1799 bytes are data and 225 are parity.Within each byte of a DOCSIS frame, the least significant bit is transferred first;when a value that is more than one byte is transmitted, the bytes are ordered frommost significant to least significant, an order sometimes callednetwork order.The CMTS also adopts byte stuffing: if no DOCSIS frame is available in the down-stream direction, the CMTS inserts zero-bit-filled subcarriers into OFDM symbols,or simply stuffs sequences of'),\n",

Datalink protocols can provide error control to detect or correct damagedframes and to retransmit lost frames.To prevent a fast sender from overrunning aslowreceiver, the data link protocol can also provide flowcontrol.

Convolutional codes andReed-Solomon codes are widely deployed for error correction, with low-densityparity check codes increasing in popularity.The codes for error detection that areused in practice include cyclic redundancychecks and checksums.
